      "Here's my new niche idea for a product:Taylor Swift.Storytime:July '23. My sisters and I are waiting by the computer to try to get in the TicketMaster queue to purchase a ticket for Taylor Swift's Eras Tour.The demand was so high for those tickets that you had to participate in a raffle weeks before the queues opened, just to get the chance to join the queue 2 hours before anybody else.After hours of preparations and reading online on how to get in the queue early and which cards work and which don't, we were finally in the queue, waiting for a chance to buy a ticket.We were given a position. 20,000.We need to wait for 20,000 people to buy their tickets before we can get ours.The queue counter ticked down quickly. 40 minutes later, It was our time to purchase tickets.Only VIP tickets are left.Well, the hype was high and the adrenaline was even higher that we purchased 3 tickets for the July '24 show in Amsterdam.500 euros each (No ragrets).A few hours later, everything was sold out.Since we bought the VIP tickets, we had to get in line as early as possible on the day of the show to be as close to the stage as possible.The show started at 19:30.We were there at 08:00.My sister (Esty Zilberman) and I thought:Why not have an app to pass the time and tell other people in line to play with us and make a few bucks from ads?We built a Taylor quiz app in a few weeks and were ready to play with other people in line!Long story short, we were too awkward to tell anybody about it. So that went down the drain.However, we learned that many fans (Swifties) have Swift nights, where a group of Swifties gather to listen to songs and do things together.That's when the idea for a Taylor Swift-themed Kahoot game popped into our mind.We could give those swifties a fun game to play together.A pretty niche community that would appreciate such a game.-Today:The app is almost ready.If you consider yourself a swiftie, I invite you to give it a go and try to win a round :)https://www.playtaylor.comIn a future article, I'll write all about it from the tech side.",

      "I read over 200 books on productivity, entrepreneurship and investing.And there's one thing that I wish I knew before I started reading:\"We need to be reminded more than we need to be taught.\"Around 170 different authors, each sharing their personal story of success and unique formula for achieving freedom.And most of the stories are completely different.That makes sense, because each of the authors have their own personality, goals and life. Therefore, the only thing that we can learn from the stories is what's repeated in each of the stories.If you read several non-fiction books, you should already know by now that what all these successful people have in common is:→ Focus and consistency.People who stay on their path to success and focus on things that will bring them closer to it always win.P.S.I am your lab rat that is going all the way.Follow me to see how I progress.",

      "I bought Justin Welsh's 200$ course for LinkedIn writing.And this is the most valuable lesson:The Content Matrix.When it comes to writing online, the thing that never came natural for me was coming up with ideas for posts.Some morning I would sit on my black gaming chair, scrolling for over an hour through my notes just to find a decent idea or something to write about.The Content Matrix fixed it for me. Here's how it works:1. Choose 1-5 topics you want to write about.2. Find as many type of posts as you can.3. Set it into a table (Google Sheets).4. Fill it with ideas to write about.5. Repeat when needed.Here are 3 examples of topics and type of posts:Topics: EntrepreneurshipProductivityWritingType of posts: Motivational - Inspire people to take action through a story or anecdote.Actionable - How can people do something, step-by-step?X vs. Y - Compare two situations for a good takeawayOut of respect for Justin's course, I gave you but a glimpse into what it contains. If you write online, it will be valuable for you.It is $99 at the day of writing the post. (No affiliation, honest recommendation)Here's a good reminder:→ Spend money on things that will help you progress in the direction you want. Courses, books, tutors. The time and money you'll save in the long run is priceless.P.S.I know you are looking for a link.But one thing that Justin does not cover is whether or not your post will be punished by the algorithm if you add a link to it. 😜Therefore, if you want the course either go to Justin Welsh's profile or google \"justin welsh linkedin course\".",

      "New solopreneurs think that they should work every day, as hard as possible.This couldn't be further from the truth...Over a year ago, when I started my journey, I had a goal:Work every day for 8-12 hours.The logic is simple. I have the entire day to progress towards my goal, so I can at least work a \"9-5\" schedule work.It's not that simple.Being a solopreneur is a package that comes with a lot of mental crises, loneliness and unknowns. Working under these conditions so much is easier said than done.It took me the better part of a year to understand the simple truth:→ Just show up every day.Some of the days you'll feel energized and work from the moment you wake up until your head hits the pillow.Some days you'll feel stuck and do 1/10 of the work you did the previous day.And some days you'll just want to take as rest and do nothing.It doesn't matter, as long as you keep progressing to your goal and show up every day.And yes, taking a few days off is completely fine, as long as you do it mindfully and not let it become a habit.",

      "Here's how you can easily burn out as a solopreneur:1. Work on your favorite project2. Focus only on what you know3. Never leave the house4. Work 12 hours a day5. Do only things you likeI have something to tell you:You are going to fail. More than once.Heck, it's been over a year since I started my journey and I collected nothing but failures.And when you:1. Work on your favorite and fail, you will feel awful because your \"baby\" has failed and you need to find a new favorite.2. Never learn new things, your business will not grow. In the beginning, you are the business. You need to do everything, from developing to marketing.3. Never leave the house, you slowly sink into a depression and feeling of loneliness.4. Unless you aspire to be the next Elon Musk and change the world, stressing yourself out by working 12 hours a day will eventually burn you out if you keep failing.5. When you only do things you like you never build the discipline to do the things you hate, which you'll eventually have to do.Instead, here's what you can do to avoid burn out:1. Work on the project that has the highest chances to succeed.2. Read. Learn. Try. And don't stop.3. Go on a walk or workout every day. You'll thank me later.4. Set goals for the day and achieve them. That's when you're done.5. Spend time working on things that will help you grow, even if you don't like it.Did I forget something?",

      "Here's an unpopular opinion:Procrastination is GOOD.Lately I see many posts talk about how bad it is to procrastinate and that you should start now.Well, it is right if you neglect your tasks and never do them.But if you have a little bit of discipline, procrastinating can be a great tool to come up with better and more creative solutions.Let me share an example with you.I wanted to build a product that integrates with mail services, like MailChimp, and runs several automated tasks for the user.But there was a problem.There aren't many services that allow you, as the developer, to take actions on behalf of the user with a simple authentication.For most services, the user has to create an API token for me to take run this tasks for him.And so I believed that it's going to be a very limited product which not many would be able to use. So I procrastinated building it.Several days later, it hit me.What if I could ask the users and guide them to generate that token for me?Problem solved!Now I can integrate with virtually any mail service that has an API.So remember...As long as your procrastinate and not neglect, you are productively procrastinating.What have you procrastinated on lately?",

      "Should you build & ship fast? Maybe not.Here's a better idea👇For the last year I believed that you should build your ideas as fast as possible and ship them immediately.I have something to tell you.There's a way to ship even faster and more profitably.→ Build a landing page.1. Explain exactly what the product does2. Add an input + button for users to insert their email if their interested3. Publish this landing page to your social media followersThat way you can get a pretty good idea to how many people will actually find it useful and decide whether you should spend the weeks to build or not.Keep in mind:Spending days and weeks building a product (guilty as sin 🙈), just to find out nobody cares about it, will kill your motivation.P.S.I am working on a landing page myself.More about it soon.. :)",

      "I was lazy for 30 days.And here's why I am happy about it:I'm home. It's been a year since I started my solopreneurship journey.And I have nothing to show for.0$ in income. Scratching the 2k mark followers on LinkedIn and I am running out of ideas and motivation to do anything.It's in this moment that the time for a 30 days vacation I planned with my girlfriend has come.And the guilt and stress levels rise fast.There's no way back from it, everything was already planned and purchased. No refunds.Fast forward 28 days. I am walking the markets of Korea, the skies are gray and it's raining. It's almost time to go back home, and I am anxious.As I walk around with my girlfriend and look around into a stores of random keychains and dolls, between dozens of Koreans around me, a sentence on the wall catches my attention:\"Make this year different than the last one\".Wow. It was in front of my eyes all this time.After a year of being stuck in the same room, feeling like everyday is just like the other one, I realized that I was doing it all wrong.I was trying to do many things all at once, thinking I was doing good because I tried different systems to manage this mess until I found what works for me.But the problem was not the systems. It was lack of focus.I decided that every month I will focus on 3 things, set goals for each of them, plan how to achieve them and measure progress every week.So for this month, I focus on:→ Storytelling→ Building products→ Focus and disciplineI planned the week ahead for those targets, each in a specific way.By the end of the week I will measure the progress I made and optimize for next week.So remember, even if your anxious of filled with guilt about a vacation you're going to take, it can turn out to be one of the best things you'll do.",

      "After more than a year of being a full-time solopreneur, I finally realized I have been doing it all wrong.See, For a whole year, I believed I had to develop my own productsI thought that the code for my products have to be written well, so I can easily update it and add more features, if needed.Otherwise, it will never work and I'll never progress.Until last week, when I realized that it's been a year and I didn't make any money, and I take a month vacation on Thursday.And if I continue this way, I'll have to find a job, which I absolutely don't want.The thought \"What did I do to justify this vacation\"? kept nagging me. That unfulfilled feeling.Until it hit me.Why do I need to write my code? Why do I need to develop all my ideas?It's a waste of time.If I have 50 ideas, I will never get around to developing all of them.So here's the plan I will follow, and you should too:Pay freelancers to design and develop your ideas.Now, you might ask: \"But Orel, what if they do a bad job and design an ugly website with bad coding practices?\"So about the design, you should pay a little more for a better design.About the code - WHO CARES?It's not about how beautiful the code is. It's about which problem you solve.That way you can pay multiple freelancers to write multiple projects parallely and focus your time on marketing and thinking about new ideas.And if one of the ideas catches fire? you can always rewrite the code to match your standards, now that you know that it works.So instead of spending a month on building a product, you can spend 1 day finding freelancers to get 5 different working products in a month.TL;DRDon't write your own ideas.Pay someone overseas to do it cheaply, and don't worry about code standards.If an idea works, you will double down on it and rewrite the code and add features.That way you test 5 ideas instead of 1 in the same time frame.What are your thoughts? Would you hire a freelancer to develop your product end to end?Did you try that?-------------------------------------I am a solopreneur who quit his 6 figures job to chase his dream and be independent.Join me as I figure out more about this world and share the lessons from it.https://lnkd.in/dqGSRDuF",

      "PayPal paid $400 for 30 minutes of my time.Here's how:Last week I wrote a post, ranting about how hard it is to integrate PayPal subscription flow into.A few hours passed and I opened LinkedIn to see how the post goes.I was swamped with notifications PayPal's CPO and Lead Developer Expert contacted me. They were interested in understanding why my experience was so bad and how can they improve it.A few days later we set a time for a Zoom callAnd I have to say that I am impressed.They scheduled 30 minutes of 10 engineers to be in Zoom with me and listen to my problems, understand where did I go wrong and ideas to fix them.Not only that, they gave me the email and the number of a UK engineer to talk to if I encounter more problems.Now, during the call, one of the products showed me their documentations and asked if I read them.And like a good, lazy developer, the answer was, obviously, no.I told that product that I found a Medium article online that explains how to integrate the subscription flow and used it.To be honest, most of the conversation was me explaining why it's complicated to integrate a subscription flow and suggesting ideas and them listening and taking notes.In the end, I was told that there are many product changes that are coming and  a followup for the conversation will be shared soon.Thank you Mudita Tiwari and John Kim for contacing to improve the product. It shows a lot about PayPal.P.S.Here to know how $400?Average engineer salary in PayPal is around $160k.~$80 per hour, 10 engineers.-------------------------------------I am a solopreneur who quit his 6 figures job to chase his dream and be independent.Join me as I figure out more about this world and share the lessons from it.https://lnkd.in/dqGSRDuF",

      "Here's something I learned after being a full-time solopreneur for a year:Never leave the house.For the better part of the year, I was under the perception that to be successful I have to work as hard as possible for as long as possible.So that's what I did.Worked for 12, 13 and 15 hours daily.I was so convinced that this was the only way, that I would sit and stare at the computer for hours when I had nothing to do.That got me into a bad spiral of burnout and depression.For over a month, I couldn't find a reason or motivation to get out of bed and do something useful.I tried writing, I tried reading.Nothing helped.I decided it was time to try something completely new.I remembered that working out balances your mood, so I decided to go work out every day.And guess what? It worked!Ever since I decided to go out of the house every day I feel much more balanced.Although I am not at the peak, I feel like there's something that stops me from tipping off to the depression side.If you're starting out, please, don't do that to yourself.Go out, break a sweat and prepare your mind and body for the long run.----------------------------------------I am a solopreneur who quit his 6 figures job to chase his dream and be independent.Join me as I figure out more about this world and share the lessons from it.",

      "I integrated PayPal into my projects.And it cost me $40.-- Short rant ahead.Before you go on and say: Why not Stripe?Well, Stripe is not supported in Israel ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯So I found the next good solution and spent weeks figuring out everything.How to create an order, make a subscription plan, etc.And let me tell you: It's way too complicated.Errors without explanations, weird sandbox-sandbox accounts to test your products.A PayPal button component that will not work if you implement things incorrectly. No errors, just weird UI bugs.And that's not the worst. This is where I needed a freelancer's help which cost me $40.Each app that you make gets sandbox-sandbox account (Business and personal), with which you can log in through another URL to create your subscription plans.Now you need to keep track of all the accounts to which app they're related, so you don't confuse the plan_id that you create.The next problem I am facing:PayPal will not let me charge over $20 for an annual subscription plan for *some* of the apps.Long story short, working with PayPal is nightmarish.-- End of rant.I was advised to check out LemonSqueezy, and it seems pretty solid.Even more so, considering the fact that Stripe acquired them.Do you have any suggestions?Which platform do you use?----------------------------------------I am a solopreneur who quit his 6 figures job to chase his dream and be independent.Join me as I figure out more about this world and share the lessons from it.",

      "After reading over 200 non-fictional books, here's my take:Reading sucks.But it will also change your life.4 years ago I read my first non-fictional book.It was hard, but the feeling of finishing a book was amazing.After reading Rich Dad Poor Dad, I was hooked on finances and read dozens of books on the subject. These books lead to self-help books, productivity etc.Now, after reading so many books, it is still not enjoyable.If you could scan my brain while reading, you'd see how restless I am. But I still do it.Why? Because it got me from being a 12-hour-a-day video games addict to being a solopreneur.I wrote more in-depth about why I read books and the 3 books that completely turned my life around.https://lnkd.in/dHWhFdt4----------------------------------------I am a solopreneur who quit his 6 figures job to chase his dream and be independent.Join me as I figure out more about this world and share the lessons from it.",

      "Here's the best tool I found for your todo list.And no, it's not Todoist or Trello.For the better part of last year, I have been on the lookout for a tool to gather my todos and follow up on them efficiently.And I am one of the lazy people who can't stick to anything, so I needed something strong.In the last month I started using Notion Calendar and it's been a game changer for me. Setting up tasks and planning my week is so much easier with less friction than Google Calendar.I don't need to tick anything that I finished, even though it's very satisfying, and it's easy to plan your week when you pile all your todos on Saturday.If you're using Notion as well it's integrated beautifully together.My recommendations:Get the apps instead of using the web versions.On Mac, you can use cmd+shift+k to open a search bar for your Notion items, which is extremely useful.Q: What's your favorite tool for your todo lists?P.S.Sorry for the light mode. Needed your attention. :)Notion ----------------------------------------I am a solopreneur who quit his 6 figures job to chase his dream and be independent.Join me as I figure out more about this world and share the lessons from it.",

      "Have a great idea?A big company will probably steal your good idea.Or at least that's what I hear quite a lot.Let me tell you how far away from the truth that is.Assuming your execution is superb and it took you:1. One month to build the product2. Another three months to get people to use it3. And another eight months month to get to  100k MRR (Improving based on feedback)Total: 1 year.Now, you might think: \"Why wouldn't a big company copy you and out-advertise me?\"Here's why:1. at least 4 people are needed to build it (product, designer, programmer, QA) and it might take them more than a month because they need to integrate it into their systems - $160k2. Advertisement, according to the Chat, The lower range will be between $50k-100k.3. Iterate fixes and changes based on feedback (~4 months, 4 engineers) - $300kSo with a total of 6 months (And I am sure I am forgetting and underestimating things) and $500k, they will, maybe, out-compete you (Maybe because you also progress in that time and improve a lot).So it's much much cheaper and safer for that company to just buy you out, even for more than $500,000 and have your product then go ahead and build it on their own.----------------------------------------I am a solopreneur who quit his 6 figures job to chase his dream and be independent.Join me as I figure out more about this world and share the lessons from it.",

      "Top 5 books I would recommend any solopreneur to read:1. Building a Second Brain by Tiago Forte↳ The reason I put this book first is because you need to learn about your second brain before you read any other book. You'll thank me later.2. Can't Hurt Me by David Goggins↳ This is probably my absolute favorite book. Goggins story is inspirational and will make you reconsider the way you do anything in your life.And will probably get you to start running, as a side effect.3. The Millionaire Fastlane by MJ DeMarco↳ Reading this book was a turning point in my life. From being an active investor, who did anything he could to save as much as possible and invest it all, to a solopreneur who quit his job and makes $0.4. Million Dollar Weekend by Noah Kagan↳ Noah makes it sound almost too easy to build a million-dollar business. He gives practical tips on how to come up with good ideas and how to execute them.5. The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg↳ When you realize how your brain builds habits, you suddenly become aware of the many habits you have built over the years. Most are not so good.And as a bonus, you will learn how to change them effectively.Bonus pick:Dotcom Secrets by Russell Brunson↳ Are you one of those who always heard of the word \"funnel\" but never knew what it means? Well, it's something most if not all successful businesses use. And I already started building mine.P.S.It feels as if many of the recent sales and marketing books are based on Russell's books. They're incredibly powerful.Q: Did you read any of the books I mentioned?Q2: What are your top books?",

You study extremely hard for every test.You barely pass most, and ace a few.You wonder if this torture will ever end.Every free moment is consumed by thoughts of studying.Guilt when you aren’t, stress when you are.Fast forward 5 years.You have landed a job.A well-paying one.Now, looking back, will you think:"It\'s a shame I finished that degree. I didn\'t enjoy the journey"or"I am so happy I completed that degree. It was totally worth it."I’d bet on the latter.The point is that you don\'t have to enjoy the journey right now.But make sure that whatever you’re doing now,looking back, you’ll have enjoyed the outcome.----------------------------------------I am a solopreneur who quit his 6 figures job to chase his dream and be independent.Join me as I figure out more about this world and share the lessons from it.',

And I figured it out.The thing I have been doing constantly every day is checking my phone first thing in the morning.(I also take the phone with me to the bathroom).That causes a huge spike in dopamine, which makes other activities feel less rewarding and not worth the time.So here's the plan to combat that:→ No phone or socials for 4 hours after I wake up.We'll see how it goes.P.S.If you feel like you are not motivated enough to get started, contemplate what you do consistently and try to find the cause.Feel free to DM me if you need any help with that.",

      "You are probably using Vercel wrong.If your database is not hosted in Vercel, there's one thing that will increase your website's performance 10X or more.I made this mistake in several projects until I realized the reason:The location of your NextJS lambdas.When you deploy your NextJS app, Vercel automatically deploys it to servers in Washington.Now, assuming your DB is not deployed in America, say somewhere in Europe, you'll get a 1-1.5 seconds latency, regardless of how efficient your query is.Let's take for example Supabase. You can create a new Postgres DB and choose where to deploy it.If you are on the free version, you can't change it.Say you chose eu-central-1, which is Frankfurt, Germany (I know it because it's deployed on AWS, and AWS eu-central-1 is Frankfurt).The next thing you need to do is update your Vercel functions region.You can either do it via the console:Project -> Settings -> Functions -> Region -> Save.Or create a vercel.json in your project's base path and write:{  \"regions\": [\"fra1\"] }(You can find the regions in the settings, as I showed before)Now that your lambdas and DB are in the same region, your requests will be almost instantaneous, depending on your physical location and your query optimization.",

      "I have made a mistake.Well, more than one.As a first-time solopreneur, it's hard to do the right things and handle problems the right way.And in today's article, I am going to share the top 12 mistakes, how they affected me and how to avoid them.If you are short on time, here's the shortened list:1. Trying to get big things done instead of taking it a step at a time.2. Using complex tech stack to build something quite simple.3. Work endlessly. Even when I had nothing to do.4. Trying to do too many things at the same time.5. Not going out of the house for weeks on end.6. Writing a web app desktop-first.7. Build product before verification.8. Not focus on my niche.9. Neglect physical health.10. Not planning my days.11. Planning my days.Link to the article in the comments :)See you there!",

And it wasn't what I expected.Before I made the calls, I felt too nervous.I looked for every possible way to delay the inevitable.And the feeling does not make sense at all. I mean, what's the worst that could happen?The person on the other line will be uninterested and hang up?- Part of the sales game.I will mumble and won't know what to say on the call?- Practice makes perfect.Will I find out that my product is not relevant?- Been there, done that.Nothing justifies not calling besides the feeling of being rejected.This is why I wrote a short script, have a list of numbers prepared and a quiet room to take the call from (The bedroom..).Here's what I expected to get:\"Yes, sounds like a great idea! Let's discuss it more!\"And here's what I got:\"Yeah, I don't think so..\".But hey, at least I tried, right? 🫠How do I plan to move forward, you might ask.Well, I ask that same question too 😅 Once I figure it out, I'll share it with you!P.S.It probably means the new project I talked about 2 days ago will not see the light of day.Q: What was your experience with your early days cold calls?----------------------------------------I am a solopreneur who quit his 6 figures job to chase his dream and be independent.Join me as I figure out more about this world and share the lessons from it.",

      "Well, this is awkward.The project I was so excited about...Is already dead.Let me explain.I thought about the idea of improving property owner's images a few months ago when I was looking for hotels in Asia.By then Adobe had a plan for the Photoshop API, which was 0.15$ per successful request.Expensive, but doable.Yesterday I decided to cancel my rest day after finishing a book I was reading.I started building a plan to finish an MVP in a week.One of the things I needed to do was to have plans.So, I tried to find out if there's a cheaper plan for Photoshop API.I found something much worse.Apparently, since April Adobe removed their Photoshop API pricing page.And since June they no longer offered any plans to extend the quota beyond the free one, which is 500 requests, unless you're an enterprise.I tried to find any explanation for it for over 5 hours and couldn't find anything but complaints about Adobe's service.Lesson for next time? Hard to tell.I had checked everything when I had the idea, so I assumed nothing would change.It took me a few hours and a few slices of pizza 🍕 to get over the bad feelings, but now I am ready for the next project, which is already in motion!More about it soon! :)",

      "Here's a tip to boost your UX 10 folds:Optimism.I have a question.When your users want to perform a simple task, like creating a new task in his todo list, how do you let them know that the task is loading?Answer: You shouldn't.See, 99.9% of the times, assuming you tested it well beforehand, the update will go through without any errors.Then why should you let 99.9% of your users wait a few hundred milliseconds for an update to take place?It is annoying and creates a lot of unnecessary friction.Instead, here's what you need to do:1. Save the previous state.2. Run the request (Without awaiting a response) 3. Update the UI as if the request was successfulNow, was did the request return a success status?Yes → Update crucial information, like ids.No → Restore the previous state and let the user know.The bad experience 0.1% of your users will experience does not worth letting the other 99.9% wait.----------------------------------------I am a solopreneur who quit his 6 figures job to chase his dream and be independent.Join me as I figure out more about this world and share the lessons from it.",

      "This is the truth about publishing on ProductHunt:Many of top products of the day have paid-for votes.How do I know? Because I was contacted by the same people who upvoted the products.On Saturday I have announced that I am going to publish PinkyPartner on ProductHunt.Ever since Saturday and until yesterday I was contacted by over 5 different people about \"leveraging their network to promote my product\".People with 450k followers on LinkedIn.It sounds kind of awesome, but it also feels sleazy.And the more I think of it, the reason it feels that way is because it is cheating.You might think that it's like paid ads, but it's not.When you pay for an ad on ProductHunt, it clearly states that it is an ad.When you pay for the other kind of promotion, you hurt the integrity of the competition.Q: What do you think?  Is it cheating?--------------------------------------By the way, I write a weekly article on my solopreneurship journey on Substack.I get deep and personal, so come join the hundreds who already did.https://lnkd.in/dqGSRDuF",

      "Planning your day is a mistake. I've learned it the hard way.In the past couple of months I have been planning my day religiously.Set a goal for the day and plan most hours of it.I optimized it and learned to leave some space for the unexpected.While building this planning system I failed to see one very important thing.I was miserable.→ I wasn't appreciating all that I was achieving.→ Everyday felt like I have tons of things to do.→ There was no end in sight.Why? Because everyday you have things to do. As a solopreneur, you will always schedule more.It's like trying to clear out your email.You know there's more to come.It's an infinite loop game.And the worst part? You slowly chip away at your mental state.I had the worst burnout that lasted over 40 days. So I am talking from experience.What should you do instead?Schedule your week rather than you day.And when you're done with your tasks, you're done with your week.Give yourself time to appreciate all that you did and enjoy the rest of the week, preferably off the social and electronic grid.By scheduling your week right, you will have at least a day of rest.And I found that in order to play the solopreneurship game for the long haul, you have to understand that it's a marathon and not a sprint.Of course, there are parts when you push yourself harder.But those should be the exception rather than the rule.In the future I will share my framework and how you should build your week to avoid a massive burnout that might get you out of the game.",

      "Here's an unpopular thought:→ Hiring your friend is a mistakeIf you're in a partnership, adding one of your friends to fill in a specific task you need can be good, because:1. You know who he is2. You know what he is capable of3. You know he'll get the job done on timeBut, it's a double edged sword.If there are problems between them and your partner, guess who he's going to rent to?You.You will be responsible to close the gap between your friend and your partner.Why? Because both parties might not feel comfortable approaching each other with problems, and you are the connecting unit.From experience, this can create mental stress and, at some cases, hostility between you and your partner.Here are some things to consider when you choose to add a friend into the mix:1. How long is the job?↳ If it's more than a few weeks, make sure to set some ground rules at the beginning, so they can handle their problems together.2. How important is the task?↳ The more important the task, the more important it is to make sure your partner and your friend can work together nicely. And if not, find a neutral freelancer to do that task.3. How much time do you have?↳ If you are extremely short on time and the time you do have you want to move the project forward, you might want to avoid all this possible mess and  look for a freelancer.Now, look, there might be problems in your partnership from before you brought the friend in.But working on these problems is easier when there's no extra stress and possible hostility.Q: Have you ever been in this situation? If so, how did you handle it?----------------------------------Tomorrow I am going to talk about my partnership with Anton and get personal.Make sure you're subscribed to get notified.https://lnkd.in/dqGSRDuF",

I just try my best every time.I get tired after 10 minutes on the bicycles.From there it's just a battle with my mind.I say to myself: \"If I give up now, running on the bicycles under cool air conditioning, what stops me from giving up on harder things in life?\"And then I paddle even harder.If that's not enough, I look around and look for those who try hard.Then I try to be better than them.Why? Because I want to be the one who tries his hardest in everything I do in life.And if nobody is trying hard? Then that drives me even more to make more distance between me and the rest.....I didn't really say all that. I played it in my head in the shower afterwards.I responded with an awkward thank you and left even more awkwardly.But that would've been a cool story, right?",

      "This mistake has cost me a lot of money:Using AWS.According to a quick Google search, AWS is the number one cloud provider.Why?→ Reliable→ Great customer support→ It is the market leader (self-feeding loop)→ Easily scales up or down based on your needs→ Over 200 services to help you tackle any problemOnce you learn how to configure basic things like Lambda, RDS, Cognito etc. it is mostly a smooth sail.I have been using AWS privately and within a company for the last 3 years and I experienced 1 outage.But there are a few problems with AWS.1. A very steep learning curve2. Takes time to set up3. ExpensiveLearning how to configure the most useful services can literally take years.I know it did for me.And still, you always get into problems when you first set up your project.But the deal breaker for me was the pricing.First of all, when you start with AWS, you have to put in your credit card.Why? Not for insurance.You are most likely going to pay something. Even a few cents.Running a simple relational database service costs a minimum of ~20$ per month for an extremely weak machine.Here's an example of using not recommended or old configurations:DB instance13.14 USDStorage0.50 USDTotal13.64 USDNow, don't get me wrong. Not every service is like that.Here are the services I use the most that cost me a few cents a month:- CloudFront- Lambda- Cognito- Amplify- S3For the RDS replacement, I use MongoDB with Prisma(npm).↳ Although it's a bit slower and is not a relational database, for the most part Prisma does make it feel like it is.And to be honest, I stopped using AWS completely for the small projects I create.Using NextAuth and Firebase is more than enough for basic needs.PinkyPartner, the product I launched last month, has 0 AWS services.And I run it completely free.Q: Did you use AWS?Q2: What was your experience with it?P.S.A new, easier and much more pleasing version of PinkyPartner is coming in a few days!

      "This is what I learned after 9 months at home:It's hard. Mentally.You go through a rollercoaster of emotions.Everything is an unknown and you move in the dark, hoping to find something to hold on to.One day you are highly productive, the other you are not sure why you're even doing it.But one day I will tag this post to show what that even though the road can be extremely hard, you can get achieve what ever you want.It just takes hard work and tenacity.I've written in depth about this experience and how I deal with it.https://lnkd.in/dq6p-VSGRemember that everybody goes through a different journey.Try to gather some tools so that you can deal better with ups and downs when they arrive.Q: When was the last time you've been on this rollercoaster?Q2: How did you handle it?",

      "This is how you can release more products:Have a plan. And a deadline.But to ensure that you will succeed 99% of the times, you need one more thing.I found that having a plan increases the chances of following through on your project, but the likelihood is still quite low.Setting up a strict deadline and even dividing your plan into tasks will significantly boost your chances.It’s highly likely that you’ll get it done and release a new product.But, like in my case, that might not be enough for every situation.You want to make sure that there will be consequences if you don't release on time.You do that by:Committing.→ Build in public.→ Write a LinkedIn post about it.→ Tell everyone around you your plan.I was stuck with improving PinkyPartner. I lost the motivation for a while.The only way I can achieve what I need is a commitment.So here it is:By Saturday, 25.5.2024, a new version will be released that includes:1. A mobile app2. Notifications3. A much easier ui4. A concise onboarding5. Release post on ProductHuntDo you have a plan? A deadline? And the commitment to follow through?",

      "I have been doing it all wrong.Starting on your own and building products for people is pretty hard as it is.Asking the wrong questions to find out whether a solution is good or not makes it 10 times harder.Not only you don't get the actual information you need, you might be deluded into thinking your idea is great when it's mediocre at best.In order to figure out whether Pinky Partner was a good idea, I pitched it to:1. My girlfriend2. My sister3. My friendsAnd by pitching my idea, I made them biased. They all thought it was a great idea with a great name.But most times that's not what you need to know about your product.For my next project, I am going to use a different framework to ask questions.Instead of pitching you idea, you should:1. Ask them questions about their daily lives2. Nudge them in the direction you need3. Shut up, listen and take notes* Note: do that without revealing it's your idea.You can definitely talk about it, but don't make them biased with things like:\"Don't you think it would be great if there was an app for X\"?That way you would discover:1. What their goals are2. What stops them from getting them3. How they currently solve their problemsAnd with that knowledge you would know:1. If your product is needed2. Exactly the problems it solves3. How to design it in the best way possible.Remember that your customers and, especially, the people in your life will try to spare your feelings when you come in so enthusiastic about an idea.What you need are unbiased answers to your questions about your product.",

Don't worry if it's going to come out bad or not.After coding PinkyPartner for 120 hours in 10 days, I felt completely drained. Until now, by the way.→ Writing on LinkedIn felt like too much.→ Filming a YouTube video or creating a thumbnail was exhausting.→ Improving my products based on the feedback I got was too much for me.And the funny thing about these thoughts? It's all in your head.These thoughts are just.. thoughts.They are not based on reality.And they tell you that you might have broken past a certain limit of yours, so you need to chill out.Perhaps you do need a short break to regain your power.

      "I have shared a few questions I had pre-launch of PinkyPartnerHere are the answers:1. Is the design good?↳ The design looked good but did not make clear what the product was about.The design has to deliver the purpose of the core feature as soon as possible.We, the users, are too lazy to scroll too much to get the point of anything.2. Is the loading fast enough?↳ Indeed, no complaints see any problem with the loading times.Even though I had some fears regarding a few api requests, those who got to the point of using them didn't seem to be bothered by it.3. What if people completely ignore it (The product)?↳ They did.The product requires too much from the user without a good payoff, so the conversion rate was minuscule.4. Are you focusing on the right features?↳ Yes, I focused on the right features but overcomplicated them.I could've reduced 70% of the tasks the user has to do and the core feature would still be the same.5. When do I know that enough is enough and move on?↳ You always have that feeling like you can do more.For me, setting a deadline did the trick. I knew I had to have the core feature ready by last Saturday, so that's the first thing I focused on.I'd love to know if you have any questions regarding PinkyPartner.",

      "This tip will boost your frontend development speed:Disable the Auto Save.Here's why (3rd reason is the most critical and is the reason for the first 2):1. It stresses you out↳ When you write code, you sometimes feel that you must write faster to avoid the reload before you're done. I never succeed.2. It slows you down↳ If you write code while your changes are reloaded, you might get weird bugs and errors that will force you to wait for a full reload.When you save manually, the changes appear almost instantaneously.3. It messes with the Fast Refresh↳ I recently discovered that my changes take 3-5 seconds to appear because of VSCode's AutoSave feature which causes a very often refresh.Due to those fast refreshes, weird errors appear and disappear after the full refresh, which causes you to feel like you need to write faster to avoid them.Tip for the tip: Don't forget to save your changes.I still find myself waiting for the changes to appear without saving.♻ Share with a front-end friend.Q: What are your best coding discoveries?",

Plus, It lets me have my backend and my frontend in the same project.And in Vercel, you deploy your website with a push of a commit :)Back:- Node (TS)↳ Same as React. Been using it for 6 years and it's the natural choice for a Next project.- MongoDB↳ Firestore doesn't work with Prisma and this was the first easy-to-use db I found that does.- Firebase, NextAuth↳ For file storing and authentication. And NextAuth is to develop the authentication flow much faster without the extra boilerplate code for different social authentications.What stack do you use to build your projects?",

      "I find out the importance of this time and time again:Feedback.I had an issue with Anton Zaides that I carried for some time.It seemed like he judged me for every small mistake I made.I felt belittled.Before giving the feedback I thought: \"Will he be mad?\" and \"Is it just in my head?\" \"Perhaps I'll let it be and I'll get used to it.\"Then my girlfriend encouraged me to share it with him so we could move on.He proved to be a good listener and feedback taker before, he surely did not change in a month.And here's the brutal truth you must consider before sharing your feelings.What's the worst thing that could be?↳ Your partner will not accept it, throw it back at you and will end the partnership.But it's okay.  Because you've probably dodged the bullet.So even the worst case is good.Now, I want you to keep this in mind:↳ When you give feedback, you MUST be able to take it as well.Giving feedback might not be smooth, and your partner might also have bottled-up feelings.So prepare to accept some of your flaws,Our story had a good ending.After torturing myself about whether to send the message or not, I eventually sent the message.Anton replied soon after with a compassionate and understanding message, accepting my feedback and promising to work on the matter.Jordan Cutler elaborated more on the topic in his article, sharing some of his personal stories and tips for giving proper feedback.https://lnkd.in/d4PwxPwG",

      'This one failed miserably.Around two weeks ago I started dabbling with Twitter.After going through my old accounts, what did I find? Britney Spears is following me.I thought: "Wow, this is quite exciting. I bet my LinkedIn community would find it exciting as well!  It might even go viral..."I ran (literally) home from the gym to write the post, excited about its potential.10 minutes later, I posted.Allow me to cut the story short:After waiting for 2 days for something to happen, nothing but 3 likes and 100 impressions.On the other hand, a post that I was 100% sure would get no attention at all got twice the exposure the Britney post got.A huge disappointment, but an important lesson:→ Just do it.Unless your name is Jimmy Donaldson (MrBeast) and you know exactly what would go viral, you\'re better off trying anything.→ Post anything→ Build anything→ Teach anythingLet your audience tell you what they like and what they want.Then, once you find that, stick to it.',

It doesn't matter.Because there's a better question to ask:'Why do I post it?':• Show others who feel the same that they are not alone • Share the journey of being an indiepreneur• Keep up with my consistent posting• Validate my feelings• Help othersMake sure your why's good enough.People will care regardless of how you feel.",

      "Do this before you release any product:Make sure you can measure success.Anton Zaides and I have recently sent out links to our new website.A moment before we released, we decided to integrate PostHog into our website, so we could gather data.This was maybe the smartest decision we took.PostHog's Session Record feature was a game-changer for us.It does not only record the user's interactions on the website but also automatically collects invaluable insights, like clicks, navigations and more.We learned that:1. There are no call-to-action sections, so the users leave quite fast↳ Most users just visited the first page and left in 12-13 seconds2. The user has no guidance on what to do next↳ Users who navigated to other pages left rather quickly3. The value is not clear↳ Most users who were prompted to sign up - leftThere's another lesson hidden here:Have metrics set in place before you release.In other words, figure out what you want to know before you measure.Peter Drucker, the author of The Effect Manager, once said:\"What can't be measured, can't be managed\"So before you release anything, make sure you have the system set in place to track.Q: Which tools do you use to track your product?",

Plan your day 📝↳ Planning your day will help you avoid the feeling of “repeating days”2. Have a system 🛠️↳ In order to improve anything you’re doing, you either wing it and hope for the best, or you build a system.3. Plan with specificity 🔍↳ When you plan your day, define your tasks clearly to avoid decision fatigue.Be flexible 🤸‍♂️↳ Not everything turns out the way you hope it would. Give yourself some space for error.Start small 🌱↳ Don’t look to start with planning your whole day. Go for a specific block of time and build up from there.Q: Do you plan your day?Q2: If you do, when is the ideal time for you?Q3: How do you manage all the tasks that you have?",

I know it doesn't for me.So take this post as a reminder to:Always measure backward.Stop comparing your current self to your current self.You have gone through a lot and you are a work in progress.And always remember:You can't measure the distance between the same two points.And if you find it hard, write these:1. Where you were 3-5 years ago?↳ Addicted to playing video games 🎮2. What were your dreams then?↳ Dropping the habit of playing video games 🚫🎮3. What have you accomplished in that time?↳ x4 failures, x1 ongoing, 200+ books, good habits, great partnerships(both life and business), a growing community and self awareness 💪4. What are your dreams now?↳ Build things that others would find useful and grow a family 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦.5. Where you are right now?↳ Building things that so far nobody found useful, with the attitude and spirit to keep going until it works and growing my relationship 💼❤️Keep it nearby for all the times that you feel bad and not useful.--Q: How do you handle hard times?Q2: Do you also compare yourself to your current self?",

Let your partner know what you think, so things don't blow up later over things you kept for yourself→ Keep it light 🪶Not everything is as bad as it seems in your head, and you don't have to make it so.→ Don't wait ⏳Don't let your feelings boil up in you. Share your feelings as soon, or soon after you notice and process them.Q: What feelings have you shared with your partner lately?",

      "🎮 This is what game development taught me about web development:The power of a Single Thread.🧵In Unity, you have a function called 'Update'. This method is called once per frame, and because Unity operates in a single-threaded environment, each call to Update is processed sequentially.🔄That way, if you're developing a game where a character collects items by colliding with them, the process of checking for collisions, updating the inventory, and rendering the new state to the screen is done within a single Update cycle.Of course, this is oversimplified, but it's good enough for delivering the idea :)The sequential way ensures that each step is completed before the next begins, which eliminates race conditions and ensures the game state is always consistent and predictable.🛡️**Same thing with web development.**🎨💻→ Predictable User Interactions: ✨Just as the Unity Update method ensures a game's logic progresses in a controlled sequence, JavaScript's single-threaded nature ensures user interactions are managed in a predictable order.Whether it's responding to button clicks, fetching data from an API, or updating the user interface.→ Task Queues and Microtask Queues: 📋 The event loop checks different queues for tasks to execute.For example, when a timer is due or an I/O operation completes, it places a callback into the Task Queue.There's also a Microtask Queue for promises and other microtasks, which are processed at the end of each event loop cycle, after the current task completes and before moving on to the next task. → Event Loop Phases: 🔁In Node.js, for example, the event loop has several phases (timers, I/O callbacks, idle, prepare, poll, check and close callbacks), and each phase has its own queue of callbacks to execute.The event loop cycles through these phases sequentially, but the operations within each phase can be asynchronous.Q: What unexpected lessons from your projects have crossed over into other areas of your work?🤔💡",

      "This is why 1:1's with your partner are important:Things always come up and change.🔄From my experience, 90% of the weekly meetings with your partner will be filled with content related to your project.Be it future plans, ideas for new features or different UI designs.It can be a good time to talk about bottled-up feelings about things that happened and you didn't share.And In those rare cases when you don't have much to talk about, you can use a system suggested by Jordan Cutler, with a small twist, to make sure you always have productive things to discuss:It's called C2-G2-R2.🌟C2:• Condition - How are you feeling about the progress?

      "🛠️ These are my 4 favorite tools to improve my productivity:1. Rize 🎯Rize is a software that tracks what you do during the day and categorizes it:Focus/Meetings/Breaks/OtherWhenever you are in a Focus session and you detour to something that is not tagged as focus, like YouTube or Netflix, it reminds you that this is a distraction.What I love the most about it is that I can later review my day and see exactly what I did and when.You can customize almost anything and choose what Rize would track and what not.2. Google Calendar 📅Everything I need to do or remember goes into my calendar.Tasks, birthdays, date-nights, reminders.For the tasks I used to use Trello for a very long time, but I don't find it very comfortable to use anymore.Tip:Write things that other people randomly share with you to follow up on it.For example, if a colleague shares with you that their brother is having a daughter, write when in your calendar so you don't forget to send a congratulations message :)3. Notion  📝Notion is the best docs SaaS I have ever used.I write all my ideas, scripts, meeting summaries, articles to read and thoughts here.From the slick and easy design to their keyboard shortcuts.Everything is made to make it easy for you to write anything and create nested pages that make you feel like you never left the previous one.🏅 Honorable Mention - EvernoteI find Evernote useful for a specific use case, which is note-taking for books I read.The tag system, which allows you to add tags to any note, makes it easy for me to look for a specific topic or book and read about it.So whenever I finish multiple books, I sit down for a couple of hours and go over the audio clips or marks I left on the book and summarize them into notes.Q: What are your favorite tools that improve your productivity?Q2: Do you use any of the tools I suggested above?",

      "One of my promising projects has failed.The reason:Bad partnership. 🤝❌In June of last year, I started a project that would've transformed the local chess clubs.♟️And my partner was a manager of one of the top clubs in Israel.In today's newsletter, I will share the story, lessons, and how I choose my partners.Here's the TL;DR section from the newsletter, for those of you who are short on time:here’s what I learned about choosing a partner:→ Trust your instincts  🧠→ Talk about what bothers you and don’t hold it inside  💬→ Choose a partner that’s communicative and engaged 🗣️→ Repeated bad patterns = a bad sign.

      "\"Enjoy the journey\" is probably not what you think.TL;DR:Choose the life you want to have, and work to get it.It will not come easy, but it's better than the other option.As long as you grow and work towards that life, you can look back and enjoy your journey.7 months ago I decided to quit my job and chase my dreams of becoming an entrepreneur and making a living from things I build.Ever since I have been working tirelessly, sometimes 14-15 hours a day.Scratch that, I spend at least $2,500 for living + freelancers.I live with my partner and she is a student,so she doesn't have any income as well.So far I had x3 projects that failed and x2 ongoing.I am growing a community by doing something I never thought I would.Writing. And I don't particularly enjoy it.I had my ups and a fair share of downs in the last 7 months,and it is not easy at all.But it's okay because enjoying the journey doesn't mean you need to have fun.It means that whatever path you take, make sure you make the best of it.You might hate what you do in the beginning, yet push through.That doesn't mean you don't enjoy the journey.You grow and you build the life that you want to have.And most of the time, having the life that you want requires sacrifices and hardships you'll have to endure.It's either you choose your hardships in life,or life chooses them for you.And the latter option usually comes at an unexpected time,with many subsequent ones.So for me, enjoying the journey means that if I stop and look back, I am happy that I have chosen the path I did.Q: How do you enjoy your journey?Q2: What does \"Enjoy the journey\" mean to you?Thanks, Melissa Kwan for the inspiration to write the post!",

      "In the last 30 days, I planned my whole day the night before.🌙And I came to realize this:Planning helps you feel a lot better about your days and progress.But it has to be specific and intentional.🎯Why specific?🔍Because the devil is in the details, and without specificity:1. You will feel overwhelmed by seemingly simple tasks that are vague.😵‍💫2. You will likely postpone or ignore tasks due to their lack of clarity.🚫3. You will waste time and energy deciphering unclear tasks.⏳→ Being specific is not about micromanaging every second.It's about clarifying your intentions to go through your day easier. → A clear task cuts through the noise.It lets you focus on execution rather than interpretation.Why intentional?🤔Because you have to want to do it and improve it, otherwise:1. You will create a system that's misaligned with your goals.❌2. You will find many excuses to procrastinate.🕰️3. You will lose momentum and interest.📉→ Being intentional means you want to build a system that'll improve your day and are dedicated to improving it.→ Having a flawed system is better than having no system.A flawed system can be perfected over time.I can't stress enough the importance of planning.I rarely find myself looking for things to do and my days feel more fulfilling.In the future, I will share exactly how I plan my day and how I improve the system.",

Write down their schedules.That raises several questions.1. Why not digital?2. How do they measure success?3. How do they advertise themselves?4. What other things don't they automate?5. Why doesn't the gym give out notebooks with its logo? 3/5 questions that yield an immediate possible solution,that YOU can offer.  🚀You don't have to start competing in big markets.Scratch it. You shouldn't.Focus first on your immediate area,whether physical or digital.Ask questions and be curious about how you can help people. ✨ Q: How do you find your ideas?",

      "This is when you should hire a freelancer:When you want to learn a new skill 🛠 This might sound counter-intuitive, but I found it's the best way to acquire a skill. Let me explain.I started posting videos on YouTube 5 months ago.That's how long the process took:✍  Script writing - 2-4 hours 📹 Filming - 1-2 hours📏 Editing - 30 hoursTotal: 4 days.And the edits were pretty subpar.I figured that if I was going to spend so much time editing, at least it'd be good.So I hired a professional and paid him extra to send me materials, record himself, and answer my questions.My improvement was exponential.✂ I cut my editing time by more than half🔟 I Increased the quality of the videos by a factor of 10🌟 I Created an opportunity for me to work as a video editor freelancerSo the next time you consider learning a new skill, think about hiring someone to do the work for you and at the same time teach you how.It's money well spent, even if you have to pay extra for it! 💶 What is your go-to method to learn a new skill?",

      "This is how I stopped going to the toilet 5 times a day.I keep the fun out.This is awkward...I used to go to the toilet 5 times a day for at least 10-15 minutes each time.Why? the phone.📱♟️I wasted over an hour a day playing chess on the phone and it became an obsession. Any time my flow would be interrupted, I would be triggered to go run a few games.→ No idea for a new post? Trigger.→ 2 minutes deploy? Trigger.→ A notification? Trigger.And the toilet and chess were just the right settings for me.It might be something different for you, like scrolling on social media.But it's not about the doom scrolling.It's the trigger that we need to look out for.When you recognize what triggers you to scroll, you are more in control.But finding the trigger might be too hard.Instead, you can prepare for it:1. Figure out what bad habit you want to change.↳ Put the phone in another room while you are working.2. Have a new habit to replace the old one.↳ Have a Rubik's cube on your desk with instructions.3. Fail and repeat.It's not going to be easy to replace a bad habit.But the more you do it, the easier it gets.And it's coming from someone who had a video game addiction for over 17 years.What bad habits do you want to change?",

      "Not setting big goals changed everythingOver 2 weeks ago I started planning my day in the evening, after I was done working.I started with setting pretty ambitious goals for the day.Here's an example (Under MUST title):• Idea for newsletter next week (Tech+Personal) (4 hrs)• LinkedIn post (1-2 hrs)• Meditation / Breathing (20 minutes)• Add list UI + Logic (6 days)• Summarize books (2 hrs)• Clean house (2 hrs)Even without the programming part, I set out to do 10 hours of work, where 8/10 hours require deep concentration. I mean, it is possible, but it's quite ambitious to expect 8 hours of hyperfocus every day.And the problem is that it builds up more pressure than it helps you complete more tasks.Setting smaller goals helps you:👉 Feel better👉 Progress toward your goal👉 Boost your self-confidence👉 Be more fulfilled with your day👉 Feel less anxious and more creativeWhy? Because you actually achieve what you set out to achieve.You progress.And how do I avoid the Parkinson’s Law trap, which says that work expands to fill the time allotted for its completion?I set up empty slots of time, that I fill with a generic title of something I might do, like “Program” or “Write”.",

      "AI is taking our jobs as software engineersYesterday, Cognition AI, a startup backed by Peter Thiel, announced the first AI software engineer, called Devin.Devin is an autonomous agent that solves engineering tasks through the use of its own shell, code editor, and web browser.People are afraid to lose their engineering jobs to AI. And for no reason.Let me go over some of the remarks made in yesterday's Twitter post.\"..and has even completed real jobs on Upwork.\"Which jobs? there are so many jobs on Upwork that literally require a prompt in chatGPT.\"...When evaluated on the SWE-Bench benchmark, which asks an AI to resolve GitHub issues found in real-world open-source projects, Devin correctly resolves 13.86% of the issues unassisted...\"This might sound impressive at first.Take a moment to think how many random, basic or repeated questions there are.Look, all in all, it's cool. It does a lot of things automatically, through it's own environment and tools.But as a software engineer, the thing that I hate the most is waiting.Even a minute. It kills my flow and makes me way less productive.Imagine how many developers will open their phones while they wait for a prompt from Devin.And don't get me wrong. I love using AI to help me write code faster and I embrace those changes.I use Copilot and ChatGPT consistently to remove repetitive tasks.But it's not there yet. And I believe there's a huge leap that needs to be made before we can consider a scenario where software engineers are a thing of the past.What are your thoughts about AI and our future as software engineers?",

      "This is how I started many projects:I jump in and out. Repeatedly.There's a notion and a misconception that:\"The first step is the hardest one\"No, it isn't. Actually, the first step is the easiest one.✨ 2016: Burst of motivation to become an Android developer → Published a trivia game → Enthusiasm lasted 2 weeks.🔧 2018: Dived into Arduino projects → Showed some text on an LED screen → Ended up in a drawer after a week.🎮 2020: Attempted to quit video games → Deleted them all → Lasted less than 24 hours.🕹️ 2023: Started building a mobile game → Built a small prototype → Gradually lost interest and stopped.💻 2024: Working on a new website → Finally seeing the light → Still engaged and making progress.My point is:The challenge isn't in starting. it's in the perseverance that follows.You can find endless motivational videos to start anything.Sustaining that drive is where the true struggle begins.And how do you do that?👉 Set clear, achievable goals:Break your project into small, manageable tasks for a frequent sense of achievement and progress → This is a real game-changer.👉 Find your why:Understanding the reason behind doing what you are doing will help you stick to it longer.👉 Build a Support Network:Surround yourself with people who encourage and challenge you to keep moving forward.Do you think that the first step is the hardest? I'd love to hear your thoughts!",

      "You are an imposter.And that's completely fine.I've been there too. Borrowing ideas from others and sharing them online to grow a community.It felt like I was lying to myself and you.But I have come to realize this:Most of us are imposters in one way, shape or form. We're all inspired by the creativity around us. We discuss it. Some of us even write entire books on it.But it's more than just imitation.When you are being an imposter you share 3 things:👉 The idea of the message to your community.👉 Your beliefs and point of view.👉 Your unique experience.Not everybody knows about the sources you have, be it books, articles or innovative friends.By sharing—and yes, sometimes \"copying\"— you are doing a service both to the creators and to your community. 🌱What's your take? Have you ever felt like an imposter for sharing others' ideas?",

Share your honest and most accurate review. 📝→ It’s okay when not everything goes according to plan sometimes. Life happens. It becomes a problem when it’s consistent.⚠️→ Not all freelancers are made equal (Even those with the same $ rate). Choose the one that suits your needs best.🔍→ Don’t settle on a good product. You need the freelancer to match your personal needs beyond what they can make.  🎯→ Good reviews usually don't mean much. Look for the bad ones. 👀In today's article, I'll discuss more of what I learned and how to find good freelancers",

As early as possible.The point is:👉 Don't box yourself into routines just because they work for others.But do try as much as possible to know what suits you.Tony Robbins did not become Tony Robbins thanks to his affirmations.He did it through courage and dedication to help people by any means necessary.Which morning routines have you tried that didn't work for you?In the picture: Me, after finishing this post.I woke up early, I swear.

Before reading it, I couldn't get myself to plan regularly. 🔄I would finish each day, feeling like I have left tasks undone and try to finish them the day after. 😞And I still do it.But now, I have a system. ⚙️🛠️And a bad system is better than no system. That way you can fix things that don't work until it's perfect for you. So here's how I plan:→ At the end of each day I see what I didn't finish and figure out why.→ Set target goals for the day ahead, considering unfinished tasks.→ Create time blocks for each goal in the calendar.Here's why you should get to planning as soon as possible:https://lnkd.in/d5RzUThb",

      'Posting over 20 videos on YouTube has taught me this:👉 Keep going. You\'ll get better with time. ⏳ Before starting to post, I had many doubts."What if my family sees that?""What if nobody watches my videos and I waste my time?""I don\'t have any equipment, the videos will be awful"To be honest, the first video was easy. It was around video 9 when the doubt really crept in.When I ran out of ideas and was not sure how to proceed.Not to mention that I was also still shy to talk to a camera. 📷 So, here\'s what I did:→ I watched other YouTubers to get inspiration for new videos. ✨By copycatting others and adding my personality and unique view to the idea, I created my own version of their idea. → Take the greatest advice given to me by Anton Zaides 🤝Anton told me that I needed to focus on my niche. But I heard that many times.He also gave me many ideas about what to write and how to use social platforms well. → Listen to Experts Secrets, by Russell Brunson 🎧 Russel shares awesome ideas on how to communicate with your audience, craft a good story and use it to sell better. → I forced myself to write 10 ideas. 💡 I told myself that I would not move without it.Then, after I was finally done, I forced myself to sit through another 10.→ I wrote 100 things about myself. 🌱Following Grant Cardone\'s advice in "The 10X Mentor", I tried to figure out what\'s so special about me. How can I leverage my history and personal stories to convey better stories?In the last 3 days, I had a shift and writing became a bit easier.  Generating ideas is no longer a chore. 🌟 I still feel like what I write may not be appropriate that people might not like it, or maybe I am wasting a great idea. but that\'s okay. I\'ll improve. :)What are your hardships in social platforms and how do you get over those?',

      "Don't hire a freelancer before you have this:1. A well-defined job proposal. 👉  Write a descriptive and detailed job proposal before you send it out to people. Don't be lazy here, because this part is important to find the best fit for you and the job.💪 Pro tip: Before you send out a job proposal, in UpWork for example, add this sentence somewhere in the middle: 'Please add 'ilovelinkedin' to your response so I know you read everything'. This one reduces 50-60% of the people.Why is it so good? If someone cannot do as little as reading the job description, they're probably not a good fit2. A budget 👉 Even if you are going to hire someone to pay by the hour, have a budget set in mind.💪 Pro Tip:If you have expertise in the job, ask the potential candidate how long he thinks the job would take. Then compare it to your assessment and if there's a large gap, find out why.3. Strict preferences👉 Decide what you need from the freelancer and stick to it. It might take longer to find the one that suits you, but it's worth it.💪 Pro tip: Don't stick to one platform. I find UpWork to be the most convenient platform to find freelancers, but I found that some of the best jobs were done when I found freelancers from Fiverr.",

      'How does it feel to learn to write as a software developer?Ever since I started posting daily on LinkedIn, I feel like...I am completely running out of ideas. But my writing is improving!🙆‍♂️ Every day that passes makes writing harder than the day before.- "Should I repeat things from my newsletter?"- "Maybe I should read a newsletter and take something from there"- "Perhaps I should stick to what I know and drop the whole social thing"I am writing this post to try to generate ideas and figure out what to do. And here\'s what I got:1. Read a newsletter and try what they suggest for 1 week. Then share the journey.2. Actually post what I am writing now to share my journey (And tick another day ;))3. I don\'t have anything else, but 3 looks better. So, here you go.4. Another one came up! Take ideas from your past YouTube videos and show how you implement them and what are the results.In "So Good They Can\'t Ignore You", Cal Newport talks about how the idea of pursuing a career in something that we love is mostly wrong.He calls it "the passion mindset" vs “the craftsman mindset”. The passion mindset focuses on what the world can offer you, while the craftsman mindset focuses on what you can offer the world.Learning and mastering new skills, especially writing (for me), is tough. Yet, by writing daily and learning from past mistakes and successes, you will surely improve!If you have any suggestions on how to improve or generate ideas more predictably, I would love to hear them!',

      "This is the most important takeaway from my downturn in life: Nurture your relationships 🌱 3 months after I quit my job, I fell into some kind of depression.I had no ongoing project and I didn't feel motivated to do anything new.I stopped posting on LinkedIn, stopped posting videos on YouTube and sat bored, staring at the computer screen most of the day. Looking for something to do.It felt horrible.One day, an idea came to my mind to check how's it going for others, perhaps I could get advice on how to move on.So, I messaged Anton Zaides and we talked. After a few back and forth, he told me that he was on parental leave and that he had a few ideas for a startup.💡DING 💡That was my moment to take this opportunity and get back on my feet.Ever since we've been working on the same project, which already had a first (failed 😅 ) release.So, I learned to always nurture my relationships and have someone to share and listen to.👉 Pro tip: Try to have someone who can understand your situation. Because I do live with my girlfriend, but she is a student and she didn't really get the situation I was in.",

      "Top 5 Lessons from my YouTube careerIn September of last year, I started uploading videos to YouTube weekly.So far I have over 100 subscribers and almost 5.5k views 🚀! Here's a glimpse into what I learned:👉  It’s Okay to CopyInspiration can come from anywhere. And it makes sense because almost no one comes up with something brand new. We just share it from our perspective with our lessons.👉  Your Background MattersJust like in life, what's behind you (literally and figuratively) can define the impact of your message. A white wall taught me the importance of adding color to your story.👉  Act As If Nobody CaresBecause in the beginning, they really don't. But it's not about them; it's about proving how badly you want it.👉  One Good BetOut of ten tries, one success can change everything. My 10th video taught me that perseverance pays off.👉  Treat It as a Learning ExperienceFrom Photoshop to storytelling, every step is a lesson. 📚If that interests you, I have written more in detail about my experience and lessons here:https://lnkd.in/dak8frQG",

      "3 Book suggestions and how they affected me 📚👉 Personality Isn't Permanent by Benjamin HardyEver since I learned about the concept of personality, I figured out that I was not happy with the way I was. I would do anything to make the other side feel good, even if it made me feel bad. I would overthink most encounters with people and feel like I did something wrong.This book made me understand that being a people-pleaser isn't a life sentence. You’re not \"stuck\" with who you are.In the book, Ben shares his perspective on this topic and explains why personality is not permanent.👉 The Millionaire Fastlane, by MJ DeMarcoI know, the title sounds super cliché, but don’t let it deter you!This one hit me hard. I've always known deep down that I wanted to create something of my own, not to build someone else’s dream.Actually, after reading this book I decided that waiting for the right moment to quit my job and chase my dreams is a mistake. There’s never a right time. If I want something, I should just jump in and give it a go!DeMarco speaks in the book about his life’s philosophy, his journey and what made him build up and sell a $20M business. He criticizes conventional thinking throughout the whole book, and his opinions are pretty controversial, so prepare for quite a bumpy ride with this one!🎢👉 Can’t Hurt Me, by David GogginsWell, I talk quite a lot about Goggins on my YouTube channel, and there’s a reason.He made me understand that I have much more in me than I thought. I used to have a lot of self-doubt and unconscious thoughts that would put me down constantly. This book was another step in my progress toward self-belief.In the book, Goggins shares his life story, how from being a cockroach exterminator that weighs 300 pounds, he became the world's toughest man.He explains it in a way that makes you understand completely where he came from, and some of the stories sound so unreal, that you might think he lies.I’d suggest you listen to it because, at the end of each chapter, Goggins gives us more and shares things he couldn’t write in the book.🎧What are your favorite books and how have they changed you?📖",

      "How I quit playing video games 🎮For over 17 years, I played video games on average 6-8 hours a day.Any popular game you can think of, I played.League of Legends, PUBG, Overwatch, World of Warcraft, Maplestory..In the last 2 years, I’d end almost every night feeling bad that I am so lazy and that my life goes nowhere. I tried to do other things, like building cool things with Arduino. 💡 ❗ The problem - I always had that voice in my head that said that I was not good enough. I can’t achieve anything great. I am mediocre at best. I have never been good at anything besides playing computer games.☝ The turning point for me was my first success after multiple failures.My father has asked me to create an Android app for him, so he can send WhatsApp messages to a client he is talking to with a press of a button, rather than: Add the client as a contact ➡️ Look for the correct message in the notes ➡️ copy it ➡️ Look for the contact in WhatsApp ➡️ Send it.So I tried multiple times, in between games, to write something. And I failed to fetch the incoming caller’s number. So I stopped trying.Then, during COVID-19, my father asked me again to see what I could do to help him. I gave it another try and I figured out why it failed before! My first success!It gave me a feeling that I could do more than I am not doing right now. That propelled me into reading a book, which I never did, unless I had to, before.The rest is history:1️⃣ I have a growing YouTube channel2️⃣ I am writing daily, and I never thought I would ever do something remotely close to it.3️⃣ I have a failed project4️⃣ I am working on a new one with an awesome partner5️⃣ I mostly feel good about my lifeWhy mostly? That’s for another post ;)What’d I learn from it? 👉 It’s all in your head! 👈That quiet, yet loud, voice in your head that tells you what you can and cannot do, actually dictates what you are capable of.Change the script. Flip the disk. Call it whatever you want. Believe in yourself. You are capable of way more than you ever thought. 💪And if you don’t believe, try achieving small things. Small wins that will propel you to bigger ones. 🚀What was your turning point in life? I’d love to read about it!",

      "🚀 3 Lessons from My First Failed ProductIn July of 2023, I started developing a mobile app for chess clubs along with one of the club’s manager. 📱We shut it down in mid-October. Why? Mainly my fault. I wasn’t strong enough to stand my ground and say what I think. I also felt like “I am not good enough” and that I should be thankful for the fact that he wants to partner with me. 🙇‍♂️And I was scared to speak my mind because he might be mad and start asking me tough questions and maybe even leave. 😨I thought back then that I missed the greatest opportunity of my life. Well, I was wrong.Tell them Anton Zaides 😛Anyway, it wasn’t a pleasant experience but it was a great lesson! 3 Actually. 👉 Make sure your partner is as engaged as you expect them to be.🤝In my case, I was responsible for 99% of the project. From designing flows to hiring a software developer and overlooking his results.My partner? Randomly throws suggestions for features and says how excited he is. Oh, and paying 50% of the proceeds. 👉 If something's bothering you, say it.🗣️Don’t hold it in and hope things will change. The fact that I was doing 99% of the work and that I didn’t feel any commitment from him bothered me. I felt trapped with a great project in a bad partnership.And if you speak your mind and your partner makes you feel bad? Maybe it’s not the right partnership to be in.  🤷‍♂️ 👉 If you hire someone to do something, pay by the hour. ⏰The programmer I hired was paid globally. 1,200$ to develop the whole app. The results were awful. The app was very buggy, random variable names, console.logs all around, and comments. Why? Because he wanted to finish as quickly as possible to get the money and move on to the next project.So next time you are about to enter a partnership with someone, make sure you are the right fit so you don’t get stuck like me 🔄",

      "You are underestimating your capabilities.It's time to 10X everything you do in your life. And I am not only talking about financial or personal goals. 10X is about everything you do and how you think.Be it personal, interpersonal, business, or whatever. I'll share an example from my personal life.Anton Zaides and I are about to launch a new website, which focuses on helping readers make order in their reading lists, give them new reading suggestions and be nice and easy to use.and we aim to get 100 weekly active users within the first 3 months. Is it achievable? Definitely. Is it a 10X goal? Maybe, you can say it’s an (infinite)X goal because we start from 0.So, assuming that’s our realistic goal, what would it look like 10X’d? The obvious answer is 1000 weekly users in the same period of time, right? Well, it can be. But what 10X actually means is setting your goals beyond your wildest dreams. So in our example, 10X would be: Better than Goodreads.In this article, I share the philosophy of 10X'ing and how you can work and achieve that today.https://lnkd.in/dPbxY6JnOver a month Anton Zaides and I launched a newsletter, where we write weekly articles on the best books for people in Tech. More than 700 readers already joined. What are you waiting for?https://lnkd.in/dyXaR37X",

We have to play with the hand we’re dealt, and there’s nothing we can do about it 🤷.There are even personality tests to verify your beliefs about yourself and give you an exact description of You.Let’s see, for example, the DISC. We’ll use Thomas Erikson’s colors and descriptions from his book 'Surrounded by Idiots' 📚.🔴 Red (Dominance, D): The Dominant Red personality is characterized by assertiveness, directness, and a focus on achieving results. 💪🟡 Yellow (Influence, I): The Influencing Yellow personality is outgoing, social, and enthusiastic.🌟🟢 Green (Steadiness, S): The Steady Green personality is known for being supportive, reliable, and empathetic. 🍃🔵 Blue (Conscientiousness, C): The Compliant Blue personality is analytical, detail-oriented, and structured. 🔍According to Erikson and the DISC assessment, each of us has 1-3 colors that build our personality and character. Erikson also gives us examples of each character and describes possible combinations and how to deal with each combination. He also foretells which match will be good in a romantic partnership and which not.I mean, people never change, right..? 🤔",

      "🚀 Are you living by these common yet misleading beliefs?Here are some false beliefs for you from the book Unscripted, by MJ DeMarco.1️⃣ The \"I'm Not Good at That\" Belief:The special scam, where we have grown to believe that there are things we will never be good enough for. This is a trap 🪤 that limits our potential and sets us up for failure. This is, what Carol Dweck calls, the fixed mindset.People with a fixed mindset believe that their abilities, intelligence, and talents are fixed traits. They think that they have a certain amount of intelligence, and they can't do much to change it.🌱 Keep in mind that new skills can be acquired and mastered regardless of your current level of talent or intelligence.2️⃣ The Shortcut Belief:An idea that extraordinary results can be achieved by uncovering a secret bypass or a miracle weapon, and such can help you avoid the real hard work that creates the extraordinary results. In other words, getting the results of a hard process without going through it. 🏃💨3️⃣ The Luck Belief:Luck — bad or good — is just what you call the results of a human being who takes chances, and some people are better at taking them than others.🎲 Unlike money, luck has no brain and holds no grudges or prejudices. It only reacts to mathematical probabilities.4️⃣ The Frugality Belief:The belief that obsessive expense reduction, penny-pinching, and experiential deprivation will someday pay off in the opposite: rich life experiences, freedom, and abundance.💰 Well, the truth is, if you don’t have a sizable income, it doesn’t matter how cheap you are.5️⃣ The Compound Interest Belief:The belief that the stock market will someday make you, the common man, uncommonly rich.Here’s why it won’t make you rich:When you count on time to compound your money, you hope that:🕒 You will be alive after X years💵 Your money is worth something after X decades📈 The market yields X percent for X decadesIf that interests you and you want to know more, I have made a complete video about the book and a deep dive into the abusive reality we live in, a deeper dive into the false beliefs, and what to do to avoid it. https://lnkd.in/dFFZrd_W",

      "I think this is the first post I ever shared on LinkedIn. And it’s not work-related.I'm not even sure how many people will see it, but I just have to get it out there.I’m heartbroken. Devastated. My mind can’t even begin to process the massacre that occurred here 3 days ago.Take a look at the picture shared here. See the cute kids smiling? the happy family? They are all DEAD or ABDUCTED by Hamas.It’s not \"another round” of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It’s not a battle between the military and “militants”. What happened here is a brutal well-planned attack on Israeli civilians.Hundreds of terrorists invaded Israel's territory, into civilians’ homes, and murdered entire families in cold blood.Babies, toddlers, women, men, elderly people… words can’t even describe the horror and the inhumanity of butchering innocent civilians in their beds.More than 3000 rockets fired at civilians since Saturday. More than 900 people were murdered in one day. One day. Just for being Israelis.Entire families were murdered. Parents tried to protect their kids with their bodies. Houses were set on fire with civilians in them.More than 260 young people that came to dance in a music festival were executed, many were shot in the back as they tried to escape.More than 100 Israelis, including a 9-month-old baby, toddlers, mothers, and an 85-year-old grandmother were taken as hostages into Gaza…Hundreds are still missing as we continue to count the bodies.I feel like I want to scream… how can such evil exist?! To Kill children in their pajamas, to kidnap and abuse babies. This can’t be happening. But it did.Hamas proved they are worse as ISIS. They are a brutal horrifying terror organization.Hamas shouldn’t be stopped. Hamas should be wiped off the face of the earth.The world has to know about the massacre that happened here. Stand with Israel.hashtag#Standwithisrael",

      "The Future You: A Dream or a Time Bomb?Ever sketch out your 'future self' and hang it like a trophy in your mind's gallery? Or set ambitious one-year goals and turn them into daily affirmations?👍 Kudos for having a vision.But, wait. Are you constantly comparing your current self to that ideal?If so, you're setting yourself up for failure. Here's why:1️⃣ You Undermine Your Progress: When you only look forward, you miss the chance to appreciate how far you've come. Celebrate your wins—no matter how small.2️⃣ You Lose Flexibility: Life happens and goals should not be set in stone. By fixating on a future version of yourself, you lose the ability to adapt.3️⃣ You Temper Your Motivation: Obsessive focus on a distant future can stifle your enthusiasm, turning aspiration into anxiety.Instead of being your own harshest critic, become your own best cheerleader. You might not hit that one-year goal to the T, but the experience and skills you gain can set you up for something even better. 🌟",

      "🚨STOP INVESTING IN STOCKS🚨Investing in stocks without due diligence can jeopardize your financial well-being. While experts often advise setting aside a portion of your income to invest in the S&P 500 for the long haul, there are inherent risks and variables that you must consider.What are you really betting on when you invest?Longevity: Will you live long enough to enjoy the fruits of your investments? 🧓Health: Will you be healthy enough to make the most of your hard-earned money? 🏃‍♂️Market Stability: Are you certain the stock market will continue its upward trend in the long term? 💹Unforeseen Events: What if life throws you a curveball that forces you to withdraw your money early? 🤒Timing: What if you need to cash out, for any reason, during a market downturn? 🔻The Rollercoaster Called \"Mr. Market\"Investing is not just a financial commitment; it's an emotional one too. The stock market is a volatile entity, and your savings can fluctuate aggressively within short periods.Picture this: you've diligently invested for decades, only to watch half of your portfolio evaporate during the 2008 housing bubble crash. Or what about the gut-wrenching experience of losing 30% of your savings in just 30 days during COVID?These aren't just hypotheticals; they're real scenarios that have happened to real people. That 50% or 30% drop? It represents years, if not decades, of careful saving and investing—wiped out.What's your take on it? Do you agree? And if not, why?",

      "Transform your relationships with this simple hack.What if I told you there's one simple, yet impactful, method that has drastically enriched the quality of my interactions with others? You might find it too obvious at first glance, but I challenge you to apply it to areas of your life you've never even considered.📅 Write it on your calendar 📅 Here's how it works: Whenever someone shares something important with me—be it a business milestone or a personal life event—I immediately write it on my calendar. This could be anything from a friend considering asking for a raise to a colleague's upcoming wedding anniversary.🎯 Why It's a Game-Changer1️⃣ Keeps You Engaged: It's not about ticking off a box; it’s about genuinely engaging in people's lives and milestones.2️⃣ Preparedness: If an event requires you to take action or offer support, you're already one step ahead.3️⃣ The Thought That Counts: It may seem trivial to you, but acknowledging and remembering can mean the world to someone else.A small act with a huge impact.",

Even though I am on vacation in Ireland, I upload posts daily and weekly videos on YouTube.I know, it's just the beginning. Things will change. I will find my way eventuallyBut it's scary.I set a goal to post daily for a year. I am running out of ideas.I started a project with a partner. I don't think he's the right fit for this.I have no income and the money I set aside will eventually run out.I have no idea where I'm going. I am fumbling in the dark, looking for what to do next. How to improve.And even harder - What's the direction?But I have the important ingredients.I am highly dedicated and willing to work hard and improve my failures.My partner is incredibly supportive and helpful.Anton Zaides is practically my mentor here.I measure myself backward. See all the progress I made to push me forward.I have done quite a lot in the past month. It's hard to see how it is going to work and figure out what to do next.For now, I am taking action. I will keep posting daily and upload videos to YouTube (which you can check out here: https://lnkd.in/dxeyJTKX).I appreciate each and every one of you who joins me on my journey and follows my posts. And also the ones that don't but raise my spirit by simply following :)",

I've discovered three strategies that have helped me get a grip on this distracting habit:1️⃣ Declutter Your Digital LandscapeI unfollowed all the chess YouTubers I liked and removed chess websites from my bookmarks. Any chess-related content that appeared on my feeds? Deleted. If I do indulge, it's strictly in incognito mode. 🕵️‍♂️2️⃣ Set limitsGoing cold turkey isn't for everyone. To enforce my boundaries, I set app usage limits on my phone and used Chrome extensions like BlockSite to ban chess websites from my computer. 🚫3️⃣ Be mindful of the triggersWhen the urge to play hits, I pause to analyze what’s really going on. Understanding the root cause helps me better manage the urge. Sometimes, after identifying and removing the trigger, I do surrender to a few games, but I’m more conscious about it. 🤔Disclaimer: I’m still a work in progress and occasionally 'treat myself' to a game or two. But these steps have brought me closer to where I want to be. 🌱So, what's your \"chess\" and how are you combating it?",

      "Girls take criticism to heart. Boys don't. Society often conditions us to react to feedback and criticism in different ways depending on our gender. Stereotypically, boys grow up in an environment where teasing is common, arguably making them less sensitive to criticism as adults. In contrast, girls often receive a lot of praise, mainly for their looks, making them more susceptible to taking criticism to heart as they grow older.📍Why This MattersRecognizing these generalized tendencies is important for leaders, educators, and people in relationships. Shifting towards a more equitable approach in delivering criticism can not only bridge gender gaps but also foster effective communication and personal growth.Of course, these are broad generalizations and should not be applied to everyone. People are individuals first, shaped by different experiences and cultural influences, not just their gender.What Can We Do?1️⃣ Level the Playing Field: Start treating girls more like boys when it comes to criticism. Understand that constructive criticism can be a tool for growth, not just for boys but for girls too.2️⃣ Be Mindful of Individual Differences: While the goal is to normalize criticism across genders, it's important to remember that everyone is different. What works for one person may not work for another, regardless of gender.3️⃣ Educate: Train managers and educators on the nuances of delivering feedback to diverse audiences.4️⃣ Encourage Open Dialogue: Create environments where people feel safe to express their feelings and reactions to criticism.💭 Your Thoughts?How have you noticed gender influencing the way criticism is received? What steps can we take to foster better communication in our professional and personal lives?If you want suggestions about books regarding this topic, don't hesitate to DM me!⚠️ Note:Please don't be offended by this post. It's merely to create a healthy dialogue and spark conversation.",

      "The one thing that changed my life.Ever felt stuck in a never-ending cycle of unproductivity? I've been there. Going to sleep every night promising that tomorrow will be productive? Done that.My game-changer? Reading. 📚🎮 Background:For over 12 years, I was a gamer playing upwards of 12 hours a day at times. Don't get me wrong—gaming can be a great escape sometimes. But for me, it became a cycle of addiction and dissatisfaction.📖 The Turning Point:During the COVID lockdown, I picked up a book on personal development, and it ignited a reading spree.Since then I've been reading or listening to books daily.📈 How I Maintain the Habit:1️⃣ Listen while doing mundane tasksWhen I am at the gym, driving, cooking, walking or doing something that doesn't require any special effort, I plug in the earphones and listen.2️⃣ Read during commutesI had to commute 3 hours a day to work, so I used most of the hours for reading.3️⃣ Switch social media scrolling with reading when on the toiletThat's a good one that over time will add many books to your list ;)Closing Thoughts:Don't be daunted by the saying \"The average CEO reads 60 books a year\". Don't look at how will you get to read hundreds of books. Start small.Each page you read brings you closer to a better you. Start planting those seeds today for a beautiful garden tomorrow.",

      "Life's Most Valuable Commodity: Time ⏳We often treat time as if it's an endless resource, trading it for things that don't align with our true passions or even make us feel miserable. I've been there myself.There was a period in my life when I was glued to my computer screen, gaming for over 10 hours a day. I'd end each night feeling drained and promise to \"start fresh tomorrow,\" only to repeat the cycle.🤯 A Wake-Up Call, Sort ofI recently read an enlightening article by Tim Urban, titled \"The Tail End.\" It gives the reader a look at just how finite our time is, particularly the moments we can spend with our loved ones and on things that truly matter.The article planted a seed in my mind. A seed that's made me question how I'm spending my finite time.👉  What should you do?1️⃣  Prioritize You: Take care of yourself first. Self-care isn't selfish; it's necessary for the long-term well-being of you and of your surroundings.2️⃣  Do Only Things That Make You Feel Good and Fulfilled: If it doesn't align with your values or bring you joy, it's probably not worth your finite time.3️⃣ Spend Time with People You Love and Appreciate: Quality time with loved ones isn't just enjoyable; it's essential for emotional well-being.4️⃣ Set Boundaries and Stick to Them: Learn to say no to things and people that drain your energy. Your time is valuable and irreplaceable; protect it like the treasure it is.5️⃣  Reflect and Adapt: Periodically take stock of how you're spending your time. If something isn't working or fulfilling you, don't be afraid to pivot and make adjustments.I recently came upon an article by Tim Urban called The Tail End.It talks and shows in amusing graphs how short our life is.I couldn't recommend it more!",

      "Would you take financial advice from someone who's struggling to make ends meet? 💸 Or heed health tips from someone who doesn't prioritize their own well-being? 🍔 Maybe you're thinking about buying an investment course from a 'guru' whose primary income comes from selling you that very course? 📈Beware of who shapes your opinions and informs your decisions.Reading a book on building a business empire from someone who inherited their wealth? 📚 Take it with a grain of salt, or maybe skip it entirely. There are plenty of genuinely insightful reads out there from self-made entrepreneurs.Personally, I really like MJ Demarco's books.And when someone you know and trust gives you advice in an area where they have zero experience? Think twice.Caveat: I'm not suggesting you dismiss advice from well-meaning friends outright. Sometimes a fresh perspective can be valuable. But scrutinize the advice against the expertise and experience—or the lack of it—behind it.In a world overflowing with 'instant experts,' make sure you're listening to people who have both talked the talk and walked the walk. Authentic expertise is worth its weight in gold. 💰 Be discerning, be cautious, and never underestimate the value of proven experience. 🌟",

      "We all consume an overwhelming amount of information daily, but how much of it do we actually retain? Not much.This brings me to an invaluable habit that I have recently developed: Note-Taking. 🗒 I began my reading journey about three years ago, diving into different subjects like personal growth, economy, entrepreneurship, and mindset. While the reading was life-changing, it wasn’t until I read \"Building a Second Brain\" by Tiago Forte that I adopted a structured note-taking system.How I do it:While I'm reading or listening to a book, I mark the ideas or passages that resonate with me or seem particularly insightful (Marker/Kindle marker/Audible clip). Once I've finished the book, I review these marked sections and write them in Evernote. I use Evernote's tag system to set specific notes for each book I read. This way, the information is not just consumed but also processed and stored for future reference.🎯Three Invaluable Advantages 🎯1. Content Creation and Quick Reference 💡📚Having a well-organized repository of notes serves two purposes: it's a goldmine for generating new content such as LinkedIn posts or YouTube videos, and it also acts as a quick-access library for any professional or personal needs. Whether I'm brainstorming for new content or need to reference ideas for meetings or presentations, my notes are a one-stop resource that supports both creative output and real-world application.2. Mental Clarity 🧠By writing down my knowledge, I free up cognitive space, making room for new concepts and ideas. The act of recording notes means I don't need to expend energy remembering every little detail, allowing for better focus and retention of new information.3. Better Comprehension and Learning 🎓Taking notes requires you to engage actively with what you read, helping you understand it better. As you write complex ideas into your own words, you internalize the concepts, making them easier to remember and apply.So if you're not already noting what you read, I highly recommend starting now. It’s an investment in your ongoing personal and professional development. And who knows, maybe your next big idea is hidden around your notes!Do you have any valuable note-taking techniques that can help others?",

      "Productivity isn't just about doing more. it's about doing the right things at the right time.Two principles that have radically transformed how I approach work are the 80/20 Rule and Parkinson's Law.🎯 The 80/20 Rule 🎯80% of your outcomes come from just 20% of your efforts. The trick is to identify and focus on those high-impact tasks that genuinely move the needle.Action Step: Prioritize tasks that have the most significant impact on your goals. Doing so will help you to cut through the noise and focus on what genuinely matters.⏰ Parkinson's Law ⏰Parkinson's Law posits that \"Work expands to fill the time allotted for its completion.\" In simpler terms, if you give yourself a week to do a two-hour task, it will take a week.Action Step: Identify the essential tasks that contribute most to your income or project success. Then set aggressive but achievable deadlines for these tasks. The constrained timeframe will force you to cut out the fluff and concentrate on critical elements.💪 Using the two rules to your advantage 💪 1. Use the 80/20 Rule to identify your most impactful tasks.2. Apply Parkinson's Law by setting tight deadlines for these tasks.3. Combine these two principles.By doing so, you ensure that you are working on the right things (80/20 Rule) and that you're doing so efficiently (Parkinson's Law).Work smarter, not harder!",

      "Choose your battles or life will choose them for you.\"You might die tomorrow, so you'd better enjoy what you have now.\"We all heard it or adhered to it unconsciously. It's really nice to live by that mantra, but there's a flip side to this coin.many who live by this mantra find themselves financially unsteady, living paycheck to paycheck.Considering that the average life expectancy hovers around 73 years, it’s important to strike a balance. You can't afford to live like there's no tomorrow, but you can't afford to ignore today either. 🤔Here are three areas you should choose to focus on before life makes you:🥦 1. Health: We all know the saying, \"Health is wealth.\" Yet, we often ignore it until a medical emergency drags us kicking and screaming to the doctor's office. Take proactive steps today, whether it's a balanced diet, regular exercise, or preventative medical check-ups. Get healthy or life will force you to.💰 2. Financial Security: It's comfortable to live in the moment until an unexpected expense, job loss, or market downturn destroys your plans. Prioritize saving and working towards your financial freedom. As life's circumstances change, having a financial cushion will give you the freedom to adapt without drastic compromises.😄 3. Happiness: This might seem abstract compared to health and finances, but your emotional well-being is just as crucial. Invest time in relationships, hobbies, and activities that bring you joy. If you ignore this aspect of life, stress, and burnout are inevitable, forcing you to reevaluate what truly matters.Life is a series of choices, and if you don't make them wisely, circumstances will make them for you—often less favorably.Taking control of these 3 things will change your life for the better and provide you with the tools to enjoy today while being prepared for tomorrow.In the picture:Me after a 2.7km mountain climb",

      "We've all heard the phrase, \"They were just in the right place at the right time,\" as if a magical alignment of stars created someone else's luck.Rarely do people see what happened before that. 🤔The Untold Prequel 🔎 Before anyone finds themselves in the 'right place at the right time,' they've almost certainly been in the 'wrong place at the wrong time' more times than they can count.As the old saying goes: \"You've got to kiss many frogs to find your prince\".Think about the countless companies that launched products just a bit too early or too late, missing the market entirely. For example:Segway PT - The Segway was supposed to be a revolutionary product. Yet, people found it too expensive and impractical. Cities also didn't have the infrastructure to accommodate Segways safely.Great product, wrong place, wrong time.But that's okay. That's how we learn to adapt, strengthen our resilience and learn to recognize the right moments.So if you take a leap of faith and fail, it's okay.It's a stepping stone that builds to that moment where you are exactly at the right place at the right time.",

      "When I was at school, my parents got divorced. It hit me quite hard.From being a social and happy kid I was alone and mad at everyone.I needed attention and I did whatever necessary to achieve it.It got to a point where, in 7th grade, no school wanted me and I had one more chance at my local school. During that time, my sister got accepted into a prestigious school. Then and there I realised that I wanted to go to that school too. Something clicked and I understood that if I kept behaving the way I did, I would not achieve my goal. That was my Why.With that Why, things started to change.I started to go to bed earlier. I (mostly) stopped fighting with other kids and getting into trouble.I saw a slight improvement in grades.

      "You Can't Control Your Future.We've heard many stories about successful people who say \"You control your luck\" and \"You are in charge of your future\".And that's wrong.For over 13 years (since I was 12) I was a gamer. I can only assume that, on average, I played more than 4 hours a day. Every. Single. Day. In short? I was addicted.🎓 The college I attended? Average.👨‍🎓  The knowledge I acquired during the years until then (besides software development)? None.🤳 My self-esteem? Low.I never took charge of my life.3 years ago, during covid, I had my first success. I developed a small application that could detect incoming calls.This success boosted my confidence and I was able to finish reading my first book about self-development.In turn, that book gave me enough inspiration to read another book on the same topic.📚 So far I have read 157 books.Some suggestions:1. 100M Leads - Alex Hormozi2. Personality Isn't permanent - Benjamin Hardy, PhD3. The Millionaire Fastlane - MJ Demarco (Send me a message if you want more great picks!)🎮 I stopped playing games.🧠 I acquired a lot more knowledge and insight into many different fields.🧘‍♂️ I am more aware of myself and my feelings.👩‍❤️‍💋‍👨 I am in a loving relationship. Furthermore, by being more aware of my feelings and needs, I am able to communicate better and have become a better listener.🚀 I take actions. Daily.💼 I quit my job to pursue my dreams. Also, I started a YouTube channel (cue shameless promotion of my channel)But it's hard. At the moment I am trying to get myself out there and get people to know me. It takes a lot of time and effort, but I am here to stay and prove that hard work and dedication will allow me to control my luck and my life.As Naval Ravikant, a successful angel investor and former CEO of AngelList said: \"Impatience with actions, patience with results.\"So, in short, you can't control your future.Unless you do something about it.Take control over your life.

I don\'t know how it will go, but I will try my best to make it happen!One important lesson that I am going to incorporate into my life is AMB: "Always Measure Backwards".Compare yourself to your past self. To where you were yesterday, last week, last month, last year, last 10 years.Never compare yourself to your ideal or to your future hopes. Doing so might dim the joy of your present achievements and dampen your motivation.As James Clear, the author of Atomic Habits wrote:"When you measure backward, you get to enjoy the progress you are making right now rather than yearn for a different life in the future. You don’t have to put happiness off until you reach a future milestone or goal."',
