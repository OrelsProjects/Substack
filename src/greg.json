Go to TT search2.Type in “creator search insight”3. Tap viewthis is how i use iti scroll through suggested/trending tapi see if anything catches my eyei look to see search data sometimes ill look for demographic datai write notes on what i learnand i see what are related videosthat sparks ideas for mefree ideas galore.im one of those people that think using data like this is your unfair advantage.if tiktok is the new search engine, then tiktok creator insights is the new google trends.might as well use it.sometimes you don't need to overthink startups1. find content gaps2. fill the gap3. listen to what people want4. build an mvp5. iterate based on how they like it6. charge more than what it costs you7. repeatfor more insights like this, subscribe to gregisenberg.com while it's still free",

Test 5 ideas for the cost of 1 month's rent2. Scale with code, not headcount3. 80% margins while you sleep4. Sell globally from day one5. Can start as a side project6. Silly side project can evolve to a software startup that can get bought for 5x+ ARR.Some people are boring \"brick & mortar\" people. And I'm so glad they exist.

The press eats it up and you get tons of backlinks and free traffic5. Dead YouTube channel arbitrage. Buy, update links, reupload. Huge arbitrage opportunity right now. A friend of mine bought 10k subs and 100k monthly views for $500. Passive lead gen on steroids.6. Free template downloads. Notion, Shopify, Webflow whatever your use-case is. Custom template for ideal users. 50k+ downloads, each a qualified lead. You’ll want to charge but make it free. Worth it.7. Build in public, but make it a game. Feature voting board + leaderboard.

FOMO-driven invites. \"Get 1 month free, invite 5 friends, 24-hour expiry.\" Growth loop from hell (in a good way).11. Chrome extension trojan horse. Fix popular app's UI, funnel users to your product.12. Gamify everything. Onboarding, referrals, feature unlocks. Users compete, you win.13. Ultra-premium upsell. Launch 10x price tier with concierge onboarding. Only 1% convert, funds the entire free plan.14. Geo-arbitrage pricing. Charge by local cost of living. Explode in emerging markets.15. 2+ feature gates. \"Invite 3 friends to unlock this feature.\" Your best customers will invite. Free growth.16. Cross-app bundles.

WiFi was his lifeline to the world.Most people get trapped in the scroll vortex. Watching lives, not living them. But this guy vowed to use the internet to escape his tough situation.He dove into coding. Self-taught with YouTube videos. Haunted Reddit threads for business ideas. Eventually, he built a SaaS app.He had like 10 customers for a year.  Was losing hope. Couldnt even pay SaaS bills with it but kept at it.He started to recruit affiliates. And they helped promote it. Then SEO started kicking in. And he had a few viral social posts.Now he's pulling in $28k a month. And he got an offer from his dream company to buy his company.Life-changing money, sure, but the confidence boost i think is priceless.Guy turned his phone into an escape pod in just 20 months. He'll never be the same again again.Went from corn fields to code fields without leaving his bedroom.No fancy Stanford degree.No Silicon Valley connections. Guy's never even been to San Francisco. Calls it \"San Fran\" and \"Siliconeeeee Valley\" cause he doesn't know any better. You love to see it.Not saying everyone can pull this off. But it fires me up when people use the internet to launchpad into a new world. The internet is either your holy grail or your black hole. All comes down to which way you're swiping.",

Absolute vibe killer in entrepreneurship.Visionary founders want to build the future. Executioner founders want to optimize the present.Product-market fit is in the metrics - product-founder fit is in the mirrorWe think ideas are brilliant when we don't understand the market, and obvious when we doAre you chasing investors because you want validation or money?If you can bootstrap, you probably should.You can't reason with an unreasonable market, only pivot to a reasonable oneA competitor is a potential acquirer you haven't partnered with yet as a co-founder is a friend you haven't fought with yetYour first idea is rarely your best idea - it's the catalyst for your best ideaThe loudest customer feedback is often the least valuable - listen to the silent majorityRevenue solves all problems - except the ones it createsThe best marketing strategy is an exceptional product - but it's not enough on its ownYour pricing strategy is your business strategy - underpricing is slow suicideChurn is a feature, not a bug - it should dictate your product roadmap The most valuable feature is the one you remove - simplicity scales, complexity crawlsYour biggest competitor isn't another startup - it's customer indifference and lack of distribution Have fun with whatever you’re doingfor more startup ideas and frameworks, go to gregisenberg.com and hit subscribe",

    "content": "I'M FEELING SPICY. I’ll say the quiet part out loud:1. You don’t need 2 monitors to work. One is fine.2. Stripe MRR screenshots only attract people into Stripe MRR screenshots.3. Rocket reach should be illegal. They sell your phone number and email address to strangers who bombard you.4. Most startup perks are just golden handcuffs disguised as culture. 5. The stock you own in the VC-backed company you work at is probably worthless. You just find out too late. Hedge your bets. 6. Too much fighting in startup land. Public fights. This isn’t WWE. Bad look. More love.7. VC is basically only deep tech or AI at this point. Really hard to understand why you should take VC money at this point unless you can’t bootstrap.8. More founders want to be like Pieter Levels than probably any other founder right now. Much to the chagrin of VCs (even though they want to be him too lol).9. There is no middle class creator. Either you’re making $500k+ or barely anything from content.10. Your best employees check slack on the weekend at least once. “Is everything okay”11. It’s still low status to be a creator in business world except for a few exceptions. Surprisingly because it’s free distribution and distribution is the moat now.12. Some of the most popular startup advice from billionaire tech founder to founders hurts more than helps bootstrapped businesses.13. The majority of tweets/linkedin posts are plagiarized at this point.14.  Most creator-led agencies are zombie companies. Creators took massive amount equity. Didn’t operate. Promoted them. Claimed high ARR. Business went down, creators lost interest.15. Buying a laundromat is a bad idea for 99.9% of people. If you can build software why are you buying a laundromat? Am I on crazy pills?16. Every major city smells like weed. Just an observation17. Drip coffee at home is treated as a second class citizen. It's equally as good as your $7 cup of ethiopian blend that tastes like vinegar.18. Alcohol is back. You can go have one drink with your buddy and it probably won't kill you. 19.  Anyone who does AI replies on social media doesn't get social media. We see you, we know.What did I miss?",

But we stumbled onto a secret weapon.If you go to http://latecheckout.agency and scroll to the bottom. See that little signup box? It's for a newsletter we call \"friends of LCA\"It's not your average newsletter. It's a velvet rope to one of the most exclusive newsletters in technology.We created an invite-only newsletter for the top 500 minds in Silicon Valley and NYC. That's it. 500. No more, no less.We just DMd the most interested people we found and asked them if they'd be down to join the list. Most said \"why not?\"Every couple weeks, we drop an email packed with insights our team is picking up in the wild. No fluff, no BS. Just the good stuff.If you unsubscribe, someone else gets your spot. It's like a digital game of musical chairs, but with valuable insights as the prize.What happened is we created possibly the most opened newsletter from any agency. We're not just sending emails. We're curating a community of the most interesting people in tech. And guess what? They're becoming our clients.Someone asked me if they could pay $5000 to join it. We said no. It isn't about money, it's about how insightful you are.I think we're onto something bigger here. In a world of information overload, scarcity is the new luxury.Prediction: the most valuable content won't be available to everyone. It'll be hidden behind virtual velvet ropes, shared only with those who really get it.We didn't set out to create a client magnet. We just wanted to share what we were learning.But it turns out, when you give the right people the right insights, magic happens.http://latecheckout.agency is the design firm behind your favorite AI, SaaS and consumer apps. So, anyways...Sharing this because I think in a world of explosion of content people want curation.The future belongs to the curators.",

    "content": "so yesterday, i meet this entrepreneur and they hit me with the line 'we don't do ads. all our growth is 100% organic'and there's this awkward pause... you know the one. they're waiting for me to go 'wow, you're so pure and noble'but in my head i'm like 'weird flex but ok'look, i get it. starting organic is smart. build that audience, community, newsletter and put in the hard work. i always start organic personally.but acting like never touching ads is some kinda entrepreneur merit badge feels off to me.ads aren't the devil. they're a tool. a pretty damn useful one at that.let me break it down:1. ads force you to nail your messaging. you can't afford to be wishy-washy when you're paying for eyeballs.2. you gotta create optimized landing pages for different audiences. suddenly you're learning about your market segments real quick.3. you get hard data on what actually works, not just what you think works. your gut feeling means jack when the numbers are staring you in the face.if you find profitable channels, why the hell wouldn't you pour gas on that fire?but it's not just about the wins. even the Ls are valuable. bad ads tell you what doesn't work before you waste months or years scaling the wrong thing.don't get me wrong, i'm not saying 'ads or die'. but i am saying don't close doors just to feel superior.as founders we need to use every tool in the box. test, learn, iterate.that gives us the most amount leverage. helps us in case we don't want to raise vc, helps us when we want to sell, helps us sleep at night.your 'organic only' policy might be costing you more than your first ad campaign ever would.note: i recommend boringads.com if youre looking for an agency that will build profitable ad campaigns. they use ai/their own software to help optimized. they are waitlist only at the moment. loved it so much, i invested.",

YouTube gets more engagement without messing with the algorithm4. promotes niches so everything isn't watching the same thing (increase watch time)\"In just the first four weeks of our beta tests in Turkey, Taiwan, and Brazil, users hyped over 5 million times across more than 50,000 unique channels\" - YT Teamit's not about killing the big creators. it's about giving the underdogs a chance to be seen.it currently being tested let's be real, social's been feeling stale. same big accounts, same content, rinse and repeat.you either dont get seen or you go ballistic. Hype. it's like CPR for the internet dream. suddenly, that person making weird videos in their bedroom could be tomorrow's viral sensation.just like the good ole days.it's bringing back that wild west vibe of early YouTube. when any random video could blow up overnight.i totally can see a hype-type feature for platforms like X/Twitter too. i hope it takes off.it's about keeping the internet weird, creative, and unpredictable.so yeah, Hype might just save us from an endless feed of polished corporate content and put the \"social\" back in social media. maybe its the domino we need to get other social platforms to do the same.let's see who/what the internet decides to make famous next.time to make the internet weird again.",

You have 0 human followers.Here's how it works:You post a status update. Could be anything.\"I'm thinking of quitting my job to start a llama farm.\"Instantly, you get thousands of replies. All AI-generated.Some offer encouragement:\"Follow your dreams! Llamas are the future of sustainable agriculture.\"Others play devil's advocate:\"Have you considered the economic viability of llama farming in your region?\"It's like having a personal board of advisors, therapists, and cheerleaders. All in your pocket.The creator calls it a \"tool for therapy, journaling, or simply feeling heard.\"But here's where it gets interesting:It's addictive. Really addictive.I found myself posting more and more. Craving that instant hit of attention and feedback.It felt good. Too good.I can see how some people might prefer AI followers to real people. They always said the right thing. They were always there. And this is the harsh truth about social:Most people don't get heard on social. They scream into a void and no one pays attention.Is this the future of social media? A personalized echo chamber where we're all the main character in our own show?Or is it a dark mirror, reflecting our deepest insecurities and need for validation? I'm not sure. But I see the appeal.What do you think? Would you try it? Or does the idea of an AI-powered social network make you want to throw your phone in the ocean?I'm genuinely curious.

Underrated app.• Visit-once websites • Apps with \"open hours\" • Creates scarcity & increases perceived value 5) Is the hobbyist ethos missing in modern software?• Early internet had more quirky, fun projects • Less focus on monetization, more on exploration • Need for \"weirder\" apps and experiences Challenge: How can we make the internet more weird?  6) Cozy software is the new software movement to track• Make apps feel warm, comfortable • Contrast to clinical, cold modern design • Focus on user experience & delight Goal: Create software people genuinely enjoy usingIt was an absolute treat chatting with Jason Fried.

Data is the new oil, but models are the refineries. Who builds the best fine-tuning and deployment tools will own the next decade. 3. AI commoditization is happening faster than we think. When everyone has AI, differentiation comes from everything else - UX, distribution, brand. 4. The \"AI native\" workforce is emerging. These founders will be the AI-fluent leaders of tomorrow's tech giants. I want to hire these people and so should you. 5. AI is eating software, which ate the world 6. Great prompts will be more valuable than great code. A new breed of \"AI whisperers\" will emerge 7. The amount of opportunity right now is pretty mind blowing. Yes, these YC companies might be the next big thing, but there are \"little\" niche AI ideas that are perfect for indiehackers that know how to find one killer feature and grow an audience/community 8. The most interesting AI companies right now don't have AI. They are boring businesses with tons of data that can leverage software/AI. What are these businesses? I'm making a list. 9. The rise of \"AI naturalists\" As AI pervades everything, we'll see a counter-movement. About to be a bunch of anti-AI people just like we had anti-crypto people. Only natural. Happens every tech cycle. 10. When every company is AI-driven, the AI term becomes meaningless. We've reached that point today.The AI startup curve is wild.

My Jewish identity was a secret I carried, never letting it see the light of day.Why?Maybe it was fear. Fear of judgment, of being \"different\" in the business world. Maybe I'd lose that big deal, big hire etc. Let's be real, it was definitely that.But here's the thing:Since when did authenticity become taboo? Are there really rules against being yourself? If you're not hurting anyone, isn't it all about peace and love?And the reality is it probably won't affect your business. Your investors, team, sales prospects should respect you. Might even respect you even more for being yourself.This post won't break any engagement records. It might even attract some negativity.But if it inspires just one person to embrace who they are, it's worth it.Life's too short for masks. Your uniqueness? That's your superpower.So here I am, wrapping tefillin (thx Yossi), proudly Jewish. I feel like a weight off my shoulders.Who are you, really? And isn't it time the world knew?",

    "content": "How to find startup ideas:When I was in college, I wanted to start a startup. As a broke college kid, I figured B2B would be a better place to start than B2C.So I booked a middle seat flight to San Francisco on a Visa card.Why SF? My buddy worked at this BigCorp there, and I had a hunch that where there's big business, there's big opportunity.I sweet-talked my way into shadowing him for a week. \"Just pretend I'm not here,\" I told everyone. But trust me, I was watching everything.For five days straight, I was a sponge. I asked questions. I observed. I listened. And boy, did I learn.In those big offices, amidst the bustle of important people doing important things, I saw cracks. Inefficiencies. Frustrations. Problems hiding in plain sight that everyone had just accepted as \"the way things are.\"It was like stumbling into a goldmine of B2B startup ideas. Each pain point, each clunky process, each exasperated sigh from an employee was a potential million-dollar opportunity.I built and launched a B2B app in 30 days. It started to gain traction.The next summer, I wanted to learn B2C.And if there's one thing I learned from my SF adventure, it's that real insights come from real experiences.So I packed my bags again. This time, destination: Paris.Why Paris? Why not. It's a world apart from Silicon Valley, and that was exactly what I needed - a fresh perspective.For a month, I lived like a Parisian. I walked the cobblestone streets, sipped espresso at corner cafes, and rode the metro. But more importantly, I watched. I observed how people lived, worked, and played. I soaked in the culture, the habits, the daily routines.And somewhere between the Louvre and a quaint bistro in Montmartre, it hit me - a social startup idea that could only have been born from this immersive experience.Here's the thing I realized through these adventures:The best way to find a B2B startup idea: Go travel to a big company and find their issues. Prioritize them. They're there. You just need to look.And for a consumer startup idea - Go travel and observe. Live in a different culture. See how people interact with the world around them.And if you dont want to take a flight... there's tons of tools like Google Trends and mining social data tools that are kinda like travelling to different communities without actually traveling.Once you find that idea, move fast. I designed and shipped both my B2B and B2C ideas within 30 days. They weren't perfect, but they were real - and that's what counts.--I've got a database of 30+ free startup ideas, if you want them here https://lnkd.in/eKicBBqe",

    "content": "Back in 2017, Islands (my chat startup) was dying a slow death. No one cared. We were forgettable.We raised $2M but money was running out.I had a make-or-break meeting with one of our VCs in an hour, and I knew he was going to ask the million-dollar question: \"How are you going to grow?\"Most founders would've spouted off about AI, blockchain, or some other buzzword bingo. And to be honest, I thought about it. It was the ICO craze of 2017. Maybe adding a token would be the answer to my problems.But I had a different plan brewing, one that would either launch us to the moon or get me laughed out of the boardroom.It was the gentle 'whoosh' of my MacBook waking up that did it. That sound was pure satisfaction. Why couldn't our app deliver the same hit of dopamine?That's what our app was missing: Sound.While every other app was as silent as a librarian's fever dream, I wanted to make noise - literally.So I'd called up this indie musician in Montreal I went to elementary school with and gave him a mission: \"Create a notification sound that'll make people's heads turn.\"The morning of my VC meeting, I woke up to a text that nearly made me spit out my coffee:\"Bought, opened and emptied three coconuts for recording last night lol\"This madman had turned his tiny Montreal apartment into a tropical thunderdome, all for a 2-second audio clip that cost me $280 and probably his security deposit. As I walked into the VC's office, palms sweaty, coconuts heavy, I steeled myself for the inevitable question.\"So,\" he leaned back in his chair, \"how exactly do you plan to grow in this crowded market?\"I took a deep breath and said the words that would either make or break us:\"Two words: Coconut sounds.\"His eyes rolled so hard I thought they might fall out of his head. \"Focus on the big things,\" he growled. But I couldn't shake this feeling. Sometimes, it's the little things that make the biggest waves.We pushed the update that night and held my breath. For a whole day, nothing. I was ready to eat crow, to admit my VC was right.But then, something magical happened.Our user numbers started ticking up. Slowly at first, then faster. Word of mouth exploded.\"Have you heard Islands' notification sound? It's crazy!\" It was like we'd captured lightning in a bottle. Or should I say, a coconut.It didn't make our product, but it certainely helped. Turned growth from swimming upstream to downstream.Nikita Bier says it best about how to grow startups:\"My biggest learning has been that when you're launching a rocketship and you're off by 1mm, you'll miss the moon & land in space.\"Amen.I call it the \"1mm rule:Find the small, quirky thing that makes people smile, share, and come back for more.Since then, every product decision I make starts with one question: \"What's the coconut?\" What small, possibly insane detail can we add that'll make users fall in love?(For more posts like this, sign up to gregisenberg.com)",

    "content": "I'm looking for business partners. People who want to build a portfolio of cash-flowing internet businesses. But first, some context. 4 years ago, I walked away from WeWork. I had sold my company to them, watching as they raised and then incinerated $20 billion. It was unbelievable. Painful.I vowed never to be part of something like that again. In the aftermath, I found myself at a crossroads. This was 2020 and the tech world was obsessed with chasing unicorns, but I wanted something different.Something sustainable.I spoke to the people I respected in Silicon Valley. And declared I wanted to build cash-flowing businesses and raise $0 of VC.They looked at me like I had three heads.\"You're going backwards,\" they said.\"You're wasting your time,\" they warned.\"You'll startups will eventually get crushed by VC-backed competition.\"Damn, lol.But I was tired of my fate hanging on a \"yes\" from VCs in Palo Alto. I craved control over my destiny.So, against all advice, I started Late Checkout, my holding company.It was profitable from day one - a stark contrast to my WeWork experience and a rarity in VC land.My goal - scale internet businesses powered by community, and on our own terms.The journey wasn't easy. We burned through millions and made more mistakes than I care to admit.But we persisted, and gradually, we cracked the code on scaling SaaS, marketplaces, and agencies.We discovered that the real power lies in building engaged audiences, fostering tight-knit communities, and finding creative ways to grow.Take our agency, latecheckout.agency for example. You've probably never heard of it, but we're pulling in clients at an average of $1 million per year creating the interfaces for lots of the AI products and non-AI products you use everyday.We did it all without a dime of VC money. Just one little funnel that works every single day.So, who am I looking for in a business partner:Maybe you're a solopreneur, and it's getting lonely. You've built something great, but you're hitting a ceiling.Or, you're running a VC-backed startup, but you're dreaming of turning it into a cash-flowing powerhouse. (And maybe buying out your VCs – I can help with that.)If any of these sound like you, here's what I'm offering:For businesses doing $500k-$5M, we could acquire a stake and scale it together.This isn't a distant, \"call me quarterly\" arrangement. We're in the trenches with you, day in and day out, helping you build something truly remarkable.This is the type of thing that sounds fun to me.And might sound fun to you.So here’s my ask of you:1) If this sounds like you DM me on X (not LinkedIn it'll get lost) and comment to this post. Ill respond to the most interesting ones2) If this isn’t you, all good. Like always, I’ll share my learnings along the way. It feels like internet startups are at a crossroads.More and more are choosing the non-VC route.Id love to work with you.",

    "content": "People who start VC-backed companies will spend $1.8M on a domain without launching a product and not even flinch.Challenge them on it, and they’ll say, “You think small.”It goes against what's natural. Maybe it works, and maybe that business becomes a billion dollar business. I don't know.But I can think of way more efficient ways to use $1.8M for a pre-traction startup. Investing in the product. Investing in the distribution.I gotta say, building cash-flowing businesses feels so much more natural. And I say this having built and sold 3 VC backed businesses.How most bootstrapped businesses start:You come up with a startup idea (probably after a couple drinks). You buy a $10 domain . You build an internet audience. People start following it.You build a product. People want it. You make your margin. Do some profit sharing. And keep compounding for as long as you possible can.Unlike VC-land where you can buy a $1.8M domain and its totally normal, cash-flow startups you scale as you go. The bigger bets come later.You think small first, big later. And it usually pays off.If you don't interrupt the compounding, you'll have no issues retiring with millions. And hey, you can even pass over your business to your children.I don't hear many founders of venture-backed startups turning them into family businesses. They’re too busy chasing exits and IPOs.So, next time you hear about someone spending millions on a domain, there’s another way to do this.Build something people want. Keep it lean. Keep it profitable.And watch it grow.It's a beautiful thing.Btw, I put together 30+ of my favorite profitable startup ideas in this database.

People call it creating content, I just shared my observations along the way.

My neck hurt from craning to see the skyscrapers. It was a world I never imagined being a part of.When you consistently put yourself out there, good things happen. This is your sign.It might take time, but ideas spread, opportunities arise, and before you know it, your face is in Times Square.And sure, I know what you're thinking, it's just a silly billboard.

    "content": "This is a story I’ve never shared with anyone... January 2nd, 2019. I was broke.I had raised $2M in VC for my startup, but the bank account was empty. VCs had bailed.“Facebook will copy you,” they said.I was burning my savings to fund payroll. Desperate for an exit, I got a lead: an intro to an exec at TikTok. Let’s call her Sarah.She seemed interested in buying the company. LFG.Deals get done in person. So, I said, “I’ll be in LA later this week.”“Oh really? Yes, let’s meet,” she replied.Boom. There was a chance.I rented a Kia Soul—not a G-Wagon, but it would do. Hotel Tonight showed rooms at $500+, so I grabbed a Best Western in Pasadena, an hour from TikTok HQ but only $99/night.I arrived at 8 PM, had a cheap buffet dinner, and went to bed thinking, “Tomorrow is the day.”Next morning, I rushed to my Kia Soul and headed to the office.“I’m Greg Isenberg from Islands, here for Sarah,” I told her EA.“Have a seat right here.”My meeting was at 9 AM.9:05... 9:10... 9:25...“Is she coming?” I wondered.The EA approached. “Sarah can’t make it.”I asked to reschedule.“Sorry, we’ll get back to you.”I literally felt my heart burst in real time. I felt terrible.Time was ticking. Defeated, I walked back to my bright green Kia Soul with barely any gas. I emailed her, staying positive, and left my number.I got in the car, put it in drive, and headed north to San Francisco. Feeling defeated, I wondered what my girlfriend would think.As I got onto the I-5, an unknown number called. I answered.It was the TikTok exec. She apologized for missing the meeting and wanted to make a deal happen. “Can I intro you to the corp dev team?”I never sold to TikTok, but it got the M&A process rolling. I ended up with a few offers and did well. I even joined TikTok as an advisor when I didn't sell to them.It all worked out. And my team did well too. From the exit, they bought houses in NYC and brand new cars (most nicer than a Kia soul tbh)And I got my nest-egg back. Why I’m sharing this:1. Entrepreneurship is full of ups and downs. Here are a few lessons I learned:2. Stay positive when the world feels like it’s crashing down. You never know what might happen.3. Relying on VCs means you’re never truly in control. One moment you're everyone's darling, the next moment they leave you on read.4. Shoot your shot. Always.Startups aren’t all red roses and green cash, but they’re fun. Now, I focus on profitable, cash-flowing businesses—running agencies, internet communities, and SaaS products. Less stress.That startup experience aged me a decade.

    "content": "The REAL truth about bootstrapping vs venture-backed startups:When you raise venture and you’re the CEO, you’re still making $100k+ no-matter what. Realistically more. You know how long you'll be getting that cash for even if VCs decide not to fund you anymore (usually 12-18months). You've got baseline stress because you want to build something big. When you are bootstrapping and you are profitable, it's way less stress than running a venture-backed startup. You’ll taste real freedom and probably take home $500K+/year through dividends. When you are bootstrapping and unprofitable, it's way more stressful. Everything is on your shoulders. You're looking at creative financing like lines of credit and growth hacks to get you to profitability like your life depends on it.Your stress levels go down the more profits you make.I've got tons respect for both type of founders, but bootstrappers you earn an extra tip of my hat.By the way, I put together 30+ profitable startup ideas that are pretty validated.

This is the unspoken truth.Founders caught in a cycle of raising funds to stay afloat, their futures hanging by a thread.And your company could be doing well but if it's out of vogue or VC funding goes down, you're toast.

    "content": "Today, is Amazon Prime Day — they will generate ~$14B of sales in 2 days. It got me thinking... where is ecommerce headed over the next 10 years?The future of e-commerce (and how we all shop):1. Virtual assistants as personal shoppers that work 24/7. \"Rufus\" is Amazon's new shopper and is ridiculously helpful.2. Human customer support agents are the new luxury. Like getting a Perrier when you walk into a store.3. Amazon gets bigger, so your store has to get weirder. Weirder wins. 4. AI-curated personalized storefronts. Every storefront will feel like it's for you. Because it is for you.5. Gamified shopping experiences that turn every visit into a quest with rewards. Will feel more like Super Mario, than Wal-Mart.6. Time-sensitive offers and exclusive experiences. Keeps you coming back.7. Compete on community, not price. If you compete on price, you'll lose against Amazon. 8. Indie hackers rise as the new e-commerce entrepreneurs. No VCs, probably some Stripe loans etc9. User-generated product lines will drive mega traffic efficiently.10. Short-form videos and micro-documentaries that showcase a brand's lifestyle build affinity like no other. This will get more common.11. Super curated, super niche products based on lifestyles. You can't compete on selection anymore. Amazon will always win.12. Shift of power from big box retailers to big creators.13. Content first, commerce second is the new mantra. I need this as a poster.14. Immersive shopping experiences that make you feel part of the brand.15. Virtual reality shopping is coming but not for 5-10 years. But it will be huge.16. Monthly brand collaborations to keep product lines fresh. Your store doesnt end when you hit publish. Living and breathing thing.17. Post-purchase experiences determine brand loyalty. Everyone focuses on pre-purchase now, it's shifitng.18. SMS continues to be used more and more. But most  will abuse it. The ones that use it well will do really well.19. Spatial commerce makes shopping feel like using Figma.20. \"Boring Marketing\" strategies like AI-assisted SEO will drive growth.21. Creator-curated collections bring a personal touch to product lines.22. Mood-based recommendations match customers’ vibes at the moment. Make shopping impulsive.23. Vintage and second-hand items will be a new tab that keeps coming up.24. Micro-subscriptions for niche products keep customers engaged.25. Standout design makes your brand unforgettable. Ecommerce not just a sterile page. 26. Social proof as a currency—reviews, likes, and shares drive decisions. But they'll be videos not text.27. AI-assisted ads. Cheaper to get efficient ROAS. 28. Experience over product—sell the lifestyle, not just the item. All metrics go up when you do that.Where do you think e-commerce is headed?Happy Prime Day, everyone.Commerce is changing and it's changing fast.",

    "content": "I had a chat last night with a billion-dollar SaaS founder/CEO. He's raised $200M at a $2B valuation in 2021.Living the high life in SF with a crazy house and a Porsche 911. On the surface, it seems like he has it all and living the dream.But he called me out of the blue at 11p last night to vent. It’s been 9 years since he started the company although people think it's overnight success. Last two years have been brutal. He’s sprinting to profitability. Layoffs. Now navigating the AI landscape. He goes: “I hope we can compete in an OpenAI world”I could practically hear his uncertainty crackling through the phone.Four years ago, he had a full head of blonde hair. Today, it’s mostly gray. He looks like Obama post-presidency.Then he dropped the bombshell, “I’m running a zombie company. I don’t know if we’ll ever IPO. Hopefully, we sell, and I get a 1-3x return for investors. I feel stuck.”This is the dirty secret of Silicon Valley. So many founders are trapped in the hype cycle, drowning in VC money but feeling like teenage toddlers trying to figure it out.I've been stuck before. I've been on this treadmill before.Sometimes you get unstuck, find that killer product and before you know it you're Silicon Valley's darling again.But most, time you're not. You're just treading water.And then you wake-up, you're 45, no hair, no kids, only yearly trips to visits family and realized you could have made a more profitable career (and more fruitful life?) just doing your own thing.Maybe you're happy. Because you gave it your best shot at \"building something big\". You wanted to become the next Mark Zuckerberg.But maybe you aren't. Maybe you realize that you can build something big on your own. No investors. Or join something early that isnt on the VC-train.He called because he’s desperate for a new direction. Profitable, indie startups. I keep getting these calls. The air is thick with anxiety. The unicorn dream is cracking, and people are waking up.--I put together a database of 30+ of my favorite free, profitable startup ideas you can take. https://lnkd.in/eKicBBqe (feel free to steal these)",

It was then that I had an unexpected \"encounter \"with Bill GatesIsn't it strange how the universe has a knack for surprises?I stumbled into my local library one day, needing to use the bathroom As I was leaving, my eyes were drawn to a bookshelf. A book called 'The Road Ahead' by Bill GatesNot a big reader at the time, but this one...this one pulled me inI found myself absorbed in it for hours on endIt was as if Gates had thrown open the doors to the future, presenting a world of smartphones, internet payments, and social networks - concepts that felt almost science-fiction-like, yet intriguingly plausibleBillions of people, interconnected through digital networks of communities and commerce, was a vision hard to ignoreI was a kid from a declining economy in Montreal, Canada. There weren't many high paying jobs at the time. Money was tight for so many of the people I knewBut I wanted more, and through Gates, I figured out howThrough Bill, I discovered Warren Buffet and his jaw-dropping confession: \"I read 600-1000 pages per day.\"Like a lightning bolt, it struck me - the path to world-class expertise, to foreseeing the future, was no secretIt was readingThat's when I committed to the 4% rule - dedicating an hour each day to readingA small daily investment with the potential to yield massive, compounding returns over time.The habit wasn't easy to form, but the resolve was unshakeableThis reading journey instilled in me a conviction that anyone, regardless of their starting point, could become an expert, a visionary, if they are willing to invest the time to read, to learnAnd my 4% time investment? It's paid dividends beyond what I could have ever imagined. Thanks Buffett and Gates.People often ask me: how do you get ahead in today's world?I think it's as simple as these 4 rules:1. Develop a reading habit (4%)2. Develop a writing habit (4%)3. Develop a idea building habit (4%)4. Develop a fitness habit (4%)It all starts with reading\"Reading an hour a day is only 4% of your day. But that 4% will put you at the top of your field within 10 years. Find the time.\"I agree.--I put together some free guides for people who want to build internet businesses on my website gregisenberg.com... enjoy.",

    "content": "SPICY TAKES, I’ll say the quiet parts out loud:1. The LinkedIn \"open to work\" badge is a bad hiring signal. Be cautious.2. AI note-taking software like Otter will flop. Nobody wants a note-taker except the person whose AI it is, and they probably suck at taking notes.3.  Cybersecurity will become a public utility, funded by governments to protect citizens.4. AI is taking jobs, not just making people more productive. Companies want profits. The idea that AI frees you to focus on your passions is pure fantasy for most workers.5. VCs tell you to maintain a work-life balance, but smile when you send emails at midnight.6. X will give you entrepreneur dysmorphia. Think your business is not doing well enough competing with people posting fake revenue shots.7. Your quality of life decreases when you screen time goes up8. I met someone the other day who was complaining how hard it is to build a startup in 2024. Way easier now.9. If you’re an employee, own equity in a VC-backed startup, the reality is that equity has a greater chance to be worth nothing than something.10. The coolest part about working for yourself, having zero VCs and running cash-flowing businesses is you can say whatever you want on X. You have nothing to lose.11. Subscription fatigue is real. Pay-per-use models will be the new business model of much of the internet.12. Instagram is one major product feature away from being pretty irrelevant. IG has evolved into an app to please advertisers (video-based) and creators (not friends). People want real, not reels13. We are fully in the throws of the email newsletter bubble. Most major ones are for sale right now. The prices are going down every week.14. The productivity tool craze is just a procrastination technique in disguise. You're not working better; you're just avoiding work.15. The hype around hustle culture is toxic. Burnout is real, and it's ruining lives.16. There is going to be a major climate backlash against AI. It will become the \"current thing\" to talk about.17. AI customer service will become the norm for most  companies. Human customer service will be a status signal. Kinda like a \"table side caesar salad or tartare\". Fancy18. Many business influencers say whatever they want. Believe nothing you read. Do your own research. Seen so much blatant lies/copying of content lately19. More young millionaires will get minted over the next 10 years than any point in history. They'll watch youtube, listen to podcasts and learn to take ideas to reality (thx AI!)20. Employees who have the biggest X/LinkedIn followings, are the most at risk of leaving your company.21. Does enterprise value even matter? If you're building a business with cash-flow, and the cash-flow is good, isn't it a good business? 22.

    "content": "People are in subscription hell. They probably don't want to pay for another SaaS subscription. New trend: \"pay what you want\" software I'm seeing it pop up almost every week on new projects.And I wouldn't be surprised if people saw conversion rates 2-3x when they switch from \"pay monthly\" to \"pay what you want\".Adds a ton of goodwill.It reminds me of Radiohead's 2007 experiment with their album \"in rainbows\". They did something BRILLIANT.Instead of selling the album, they did a pay as you want and even included in option to pay $0.At the time, it was unheard of. But the bet paid off big time.Over 1.2 million people downloaded it in the first month and they made WAY more money than their previous album.Sure, a bunch of people paid $0. And Radiohead needed to have zero ego about that. But it was worth it.Now we're applying that model to software businesses.Pay as you want is definitely more risk, but probably worth it for many high margin businesses.And occasionally you'll see a whale give you an wild amount for your product.People are probably paying for $1000 for Sublime (see screenshot below). God bless 'em.I think you're going to see a lot of indiehackers/solopreneurs use this model.Especially as AI drives the cost of building software business so down.The way to do it (you can bookmark this):1. Launch new product2. For beta release make it pay as you want3. Drive buzz4. PrintSo, this way, you've creating scarcity for people to try the product. And that's exactly what you want in a beta period.You can keep pay as you want as your business model, or move to traditional monthly subscriptions once you're out of beta.Win-win.It would be cool if the big tech players will play catch up on this model.Imagine if Figma or Notion or even Google launch a product that would be pay what you want?I'd say sign me up, pal.What do you think of \"pay what you want\"?",

I wouldn't say an \"idol,\" but tbh, pretty close.This guy ran a publicly traded fintech app. I told him I wanted to collaborate. To my shock, he replied in 2 minutes: \"Meet me in my office tomorrow.\"Mind blown. Didn’t expect a reply, let alone an invite.I knew I couldn’t just show up and say, “Hey, can I pick your brain?”So, I pulled an all-nighter. I dissected his entire app, and put together a deck with 20 ideas on how build a community to supercharge his business and how to boost his app’s conversion rates.Walked into his skyscraper office with my deck. His assistant said, “You have 20 minutes.”Heart pounding. Showtime.I made it all about him, his app, his vision. But inside, I craved his take on my life, my app, and whether I should drop out of school.I was surprised by how much I learned just by watching his reactions. His insights on product, marketing, business, and life were invaluable. Unexpectedly, making it about him taught me more than I could’ve imagined.I soaked up his insights on product, marketing, business, and life.At the end I got the validation I wanted: “This is really helpful. Thank you.”As I left, he said, “Come back tomorrow with more ideas.”And I did.Why am I telling you this? Because I'm just reflecting on a Saturday afternoon over a nice coffe that 1 bold DM can change your life.Life’s too short not to shoot your shot. You don't need 1M followers. You don't need to be a well-known founder. Those are just excuses.I’m often surprised by how receptive people are.Maybe you will be too.",

    "content": "Just got an email from Notion – they're hiking prices by 20%. Ouch.This isn't just Notion - it’s a trend. SaaS companies are jacking up prices by 10-30% overnight, expecting you to just deal with it.Sure, if they’re delivering that much extra value, it’s a no-brainer. But let’s be real – many aren’t, and it makes you want to jump ship.Two trends happening with SaaS and how to take advantage:Trend #1: The rise of the low-cost SaaS.I call it the wholesalification of SaaS (think Costco) They'll offer the same (if not better) services at lower prices. SaaS is hitting its own Costco phase.  Thanks to AI, copying a software product is almost becoming free. It won't be perfect. But it'll be pretty darn good. 90% of the same features.So, why stick to Slack when there's a more wallet-friendly option out there? Take Zoho, for example. They've mastered the art of taking hit SaaS products and selling them for less. $1B ARR with 50 products, 15,000 employees, 100M+ users, is probably worth $50B based in India (far from Silicon Valley) and never raised $1 from anyone. Goals. How to do it: 1. Make a list of vertical software companies 2. Prioritize by need and lifetime value of customer 3. Clone yet create beautiful brand, copy, design, community  (or just localize it to certain geographies)4. Offer product at 50%+ less Trend #2: Pay Per Task or Lifetime DealsNobody wants another subscription right now. We’re all in subscription hell.Sure, if it’s dirt cheap, we might bite. But for most SaaS products, it’s worth considering lifetime or yearly deals (ditch the monthly plans).Lots of companies are trying lifetime deals, and they might lose money by year 3. You don’t want that. But if you can make it work, people will flock to you.Then there's pay-per-usage (or pay-per-task). As AI agents become more popular, pay-per-task will outshine usage-based pricing.Here’s my playbook if I were competing in SaaS:1. Find a popular niche SaaS app. Incubate or acquire.2. Compete on business model (lifetime deal or pay-per-task).You'd be surprised at the buzz these models generate. People love talking about them because they’re sick of being buried in monthly subscriptions.If you made it this far, I put together a database of 30+ free startup ideas I love (including SaaS)  for the taking.https://lnkd.in/eEQwvrCu So, i'll end with this:It's one of my biggest learnings in my 20s.When trends push people away, that's your signal to pull them in. Create for the overlooked, and watch the magic happen.You might not create the next Notion, but you might create the next Zoho.Enjoy.",

    "content": "The best marketing people I've worked with have 5 core skills in common. Let’s see if this describes you:1. You know how to write for the internet (virality).Crafting headlines that hook, stories that stick, and messages that move. It’s not about writing essays; it’s about creating content that goes viral. You understand the power of a well-placed tweet, a catchy blog post, or a viral video.2. You know how to throw a good party (community).Building a brand is like hosting a killer party. You create an environment where people feel welcome, engaged, and excited to be there. You understand the importance of community and know how to foster connections. You’re the person who brings people together, both online and offline.3. You’re the internet's creative director (short-form video).You get what makes people stop scrolling on short form video. You know the difference between when something should be overly-produced or raw and real. You create hooks that grab attention in the first 3 seconds. You obsess about retention curves. TikToks, Reels, YouTube Shorts – you master them all.4. You experiment. A lot.The best marketers are mad scientists. You’re constantly testing new ideas, analyzing results, and iterating. You’re not afraid to fail because you know each failure brings you closer to success. You run A/B tests, try out new platforms, and aren’t afraid to take risks.5. You have good taste in the niche.Good taste is about knowing what’s cool before it’s cool. You have a finger on the pulse of your niche, knowing what trends are emerging, and you can curate content and experiences that resonate with your audience. You’re not just following trends; you’re setting them.If you’re nodding along, you’re on the right path. But if you’re missing one of these, it’s time to level up.Start writing every day. Tweet, blog, vlogging. Practice makes perfect.Host events. Start small. Virtual meetups, webinars, or even Twitter Spaces. Get a feel for what your audience enjoys.Run experiments. A/B test everything. Headlines, images, content formats. Learn what works and what doesn’t.Cultivate taste. Follow industry leaders, stay updated on trends, and expose yourself to a variety of content. Develop a sense for what’s next.In today’s world, being a great marketer means being versatile. You need to be a writer, a host, an experimenter, and a tastemaker. And it's worth it.A good marketer is more powerful today than ever. You've got AI and no-code tools just waiting for you.You've got billions of people on social waiting for you to reach them. Startups scale faster than ever.It's a beautiful thing.",

    "content": "Inflation is killing the big 200+ person wedding. Who wants to blow $100,000 on a single day? New trend alert: Micro weddings (and 2 startup ideas worth taking)I got married recently. No hundred-person guest list. No fancy venue. Just 14 people, including my wife and me.It was intimate. It was personal. It was perfect.We had dinner at our favorite French restaurant. Steak frites and red wine. That’s it. Wouldn't change a thing. And guess what? We’re not alone. Micro-weddings are trending, especially in major cities like NYC, LA etcWith costs per guest soaring over $1,000 (thanks, inflation), couples are saying \"I don't\" to big, expensive weddings.Here’s some ideas around the trend with low risk, high rewardStartup idea #1: Airbnb Experiences but for Micro-WeddingsAirbnb probably does $1B/year on their experiences (my best projection), but don't cover micro-weddings. Imagine getting married in the Sequoias, surrounded by towering trees. Or upstate NY, surrounded by rolling hills.All for just $5,000. A Reddit post went viral where a couple broke down their $23,000 micro-wedding in LA. This validates the idea.Create a micro-wedding planning agency. Offer all-inclusive packages that streamline the process.One company, Our Little Wedding, is already doing it in San Francisco. They offer elopement packages starting at $5,000.You get a private ceremony, photography, florals, dinner, and a cake. All in a stunning location.The best part? Couples feel like they’re saving money. They’re happy to spend $5k when they thought they’d spend $50k.Over time, you become the Airbnb Experiences for micro-weddings. Expand beyond micro-weddings eventually. Who knows? Maybe sell to Airbnb for $100M.How to get started:1) Identify unique venues. Think outside the box – gardens, libraries, rooftops.2) Create a killer website with SEO-optimized content about micro-weddings.3) Run targeted ads on Instagram and Pinterest. Show off stunning micro-wedding visuals Okay, I'll give you another startup idea that might get your creative juices flowing.Startup idea #2: Micro-Wedding Content HubStart a website that’s the ultimate resource for everything micro-weddings.This is part of a bigger trend which is there's too much info out there. People want taste and curation. How to get started:1) Curate inspirational stories and real wedding examples. 2) Offer planning guides, checklists, and vendor directories. 90% in short form video.3) Monetize through affiliate/paid memberships.So, here's the blueprint how to create these types of businesses:1) Observe trends IRL2) Use Google Trends to find new related trends3) Use Reddit to validate the idea and decide geography to launch with 4) Build audience (short form video) to drive traffic/clarify offer5) Use AI/No-code to launch mvp6) Start printing, start iterating.Want more ideas? 30+ free startup ideas here https://lnkd.in/dGt8Cch4Free for now, not forever.",

    "content": "In 2013, at 23, I felt on top of the world. I'd just sold my company for $5M. Well, kinda. I'll tell you the story of how I lost it all.The $5M was in stock in a VC-backed company. But not just any stock.This company wasn't just any company.The company was doing $35M in revenue, with 70% gross margins.It was backed by Silicon Valley's who's who. I was living the dream. Or so I thought.My thinking was simple: Worst case? We'd cut staff, print $20M/year. And that rate, I'd easy be able to get my $5M of stock out, maybe even more. How could it go wrong? Spoiler alert: It did. Lol.Slowly, then all at once, we became a zombie company.Revenue started declining. Growth stalled. VCs lost interest.Here's the thing about the VC model. They care about growth and the next big unicorn.We looked like a donkey with a party hat.Suddenly, no one wanted to fund us. We had to sell. Fast. We found a buyer. People congratulated us. But I knew the truth: This wasn't a success.The outcome? We got nothing. Zip. Nada. My $5M paper fortune? Gone with the wind.But here's the silver lining: I learned this lesson at 23, not 43.Fast forward to today:I run a different kind of company. We're profitable. We grow steadily. No VC money. No paper valuations.The best part of my job now is sending out profit shares. 2x a year.Our team's reaction is priceless: \"Wow, thank you! This is real?\"They're used to VC-backed startups:1. Equity worth millions (on paper)2. Promises of future riches3. Reality - 90%+ of the time worth nothingI've been there, worn the t-shirt. VC equity is just gravy. Maybe it pays off, probably not.But profit shares? That's real money.In your bank account. Buy a car. Put a down payment on a house. Live your life now, not in some hypothetical future.This is why we're seeing the rise of the dividend startup. More and more people are choosing real money over paper unicorns.Here's my lesson learned:Build a business that prints cash, not promises. Focus on profitability, not vanity metrics. Grow steadily, not at all costs.Your team will thank you. Your stress levels will thank you. Your bank account will definitely thank you.Am I grateful for my $5M lesson? Absolutely. It shaped who I am today.So here's to failing young, learning fast, and building businesses that matter.Real value. Real profits. Real impact.I'm not saying you can't build a VC-backed business and build wealth. You totally can.But the odds are stacked against you.And most employees think when they join a VC-backed rocketship, that their stock is as good as gold.It usually isn't. Sharing this story in case it's useful to someone.The rise of the dividend startup isn't just coming.It's here.--Woah, thank you!

    "content": "Let me introduce you to your new mentor.You don’t need a billionaire mentor. Your mentor is the market.It’s taking an idea, and putting it out there.Seeing what people think. Or the just ignoring it altogether.That’s the mentor you need.So many people are waiting for the perfect mentor to guide them, to validate their ideas, to show them the way.What I love about the \"market mentor\"The market doesn’t sugarcoat or give you vague advice. It gives you raw, unfiltered feedback. It’s about taking an idea, putting it out there, and observing the reaction.Will people notice? Will they care? Will they engage?The market tells you what works and what doesn’t, and it does so without bias. It’s in the conversion rates of your ads, the engagement of your content, and the sales of your products. These metrics are your lessons.Every piece of feedback from the market helps you refine your intuition, sharpening your sense of what resonates and what falls flat. This process of iteration and adaptation builds a kind of wisdom that no single mentor could impart.The best advice comes from the trenches. Mentors often provide insights that are biased, outdated, and not tailored to your unique situation. They give second-hand advice that lacks the immediacy and relevance of real-world experience. The market, however, offers personalized mentorship. It’s your constant, unbiased advisor, giving you feedback that’s specific to your context and challenges.True mastery comes from engaging directly with reality, not from second-hand advice. The market is brutal, but it’s honest. It guides you through its reactions, teaching you more than any individual could.In the end, the market’s feedback is the most reliable mentor you’ll ever have. Trust it, learn from it, and let it shape your path.That’s all you need.Meet your new mentor. Say hello.Not what you thought they'd look like.But probably better.I'm doing a live startup ideas brainstorm today at 1p EST. Bring your ideas and me and 100+ other people will give you feedback.Or just come to listen in. https://lnkd.in/eyh7Mh4c Don't forget to subscribe here so you don't miss it: https://lnkd.in/ebpMJaHS",

    "content": "How to win in your 20s (read if you're any age):1. Don’t send angry emails/texts. Wait 24 hours. Eat, sleep, chill and remember that it’s not worth it2. Be a YouTube. You’re young, you know how to film well. Pick a niche, share 1 video a day, and let it compound. By 30, you have 100k subs3. Move to a big city. Don’t have to live there forever, but being in NYC or SF even for a short while will pay you back like crazy in your 30s.4. Be a generalist. The internet belongs to people who understand design, copy, paid ads, new technologies.5. Accept the days. Good days, bad days. Being okay with the randomness of life.6. Launch one new thing per year. It’s the only way to really learn to become a generalist.7. Do everything you can to not get into debt.8. Get insanely good at cold DMs.9. Build a bunch of internet MRR (monthly recurring revenue). Don’t rush into building a VC-backed startup. Your odds of building your nest egg that way are tiny with VC. For 99% of people, securing the bag will be a weight off your shoulders.10. Buy a high-quality set of headphones. When the beats are hitting, you’ll be more inspired to create and publish your work on the internet.11. Be addicted to real dopamine, not digital dopamine. Laughing with friends. Seeing a sunrise. That’s the real stuff.12. Create a \"failure resume\". Document your mistakes and what you learned from them. This helps normalize failure and turn it into a powerful tool for growth. You'll read it and be reminded.13. Write a weekly reflection. Spend 10 minutes every Sunday to reflect on the past week. What went well? What didn’t? What can you improve? 14. Sacrificing your reputation in the short term is always a bad idea.15. Your 20s are about variety. To learn what you like/dislike. The rest of your life will be to apply those learnings.16. Learn to cook a few staple meals. Not only will this save you money, but it’s also a valuable life skill. 17. Turn your quirks into assets. If you have a unique hobby or an unusual skill, showcase it. 18. Know that other people’s negativity is not yours. There are many insecure, sad people on this planet. Their sadness comes out in strange ways.19. Travel often but have a home base. Home base keeps you grounded, travel keeps you evolving.20. You don’t need the last word.21. Fruit is as good as candy22. Create a personal mission statement. Clarify what you stand for and what you want to achieve in your life. It’s OK if you change it23. Surround yourself with people who think big. If you can’t find them, listen to their pods/read their books24. Don't get a \"safe\" job at a big company. 500k tech workers have gotten laid off since 2022. Join a smaller company and soak up as much as you can learn.25. Be kind, trust your gut, work hard and you'll do wellIf this spoke to you, find guides of how to win on the internet/life at gregisenberg.com and subscribe.",

    "content": "Today, I met an entrepreneur who shared a simple clear framework for founders about \"startup exits\". There are 3 types of exits:1) Car Changing Money – Enough to upgrade your ride.2) House Changing Money – Enough to change your address.3) Life Changing Money – Enough to redefine your trajectory.It’s a clever distinction that got me thinking deeper about the paths laid before us as entrepreneurs.- Venture-backed startups—the ones that headline news stories—offer a roughly 20% shot at life-changing money, the kind that alters everything.But what's often glossed over is the silent majority, 80% by count, who after perhaps 7 years, have little to show but modest pay and burgeoning grey hairs. It’s a high-stakes game where the house often wins.- Cash-flowing startups — Initially, your indie cash-flowing products won't turn heads. A product doing $1k a month in MRR might elicit a patronizing \"that's cute\" from the venture crowd. But this just the seedling from which greater growth can sprout. As you add products, expand from a solopreneur to a multipreneur, these numbers can balloon—$10k, $100k, $1M monthly.With no venture capitalist, you’re forced to build a fundamentally profitable business. This not only fuels growth but also sweetens the pot at exit. Cash-flowing assets become coveted treasures, especially in bear markets where they're as rare as water in a desert. And with a cleaner cap table, getting these deals done are way more easy.Contrast this with venture-backed ventures during bear markets, mergers and acquisitions dry up, and without perfect timing, many are left stranded without an exit, just out of reach of the runway.So, as you plot your course, ask yourself what you’re optimizing for: Is it the car, the house, or life itself? Each choice carries its own set of risks and rewards, each path a different reflection of what success looks like to you.I’ve come to realize, the less obvious paths often lead to the most interesting destinations.So, all that to say…Decide what you’re trying to optimize for.Car, house, or life-changing money.",

    "content": "12 ideas, opportunities and things I’m thinking about right now:1. Finding mispriced assets. Is this business worth 2X EBITDA or 6X? In an AI world, some businesses are worth a whole lot less or a whole lot more than we think.  That spread is your retirement.2. Data is the new oil. NewsCorp did a $250M deal with OpenAI. Reddit inked $60M/year with Google. What non-obvious data sources will be valuable to LLMs in the future? Think about the unique data you have or can access.3. Localizing apps. I found an app crushing it in Pakistan that would thrive in the US. No need to reinvent the wheel. Just localize and scale. Check app store charts for different countries and bring validated products to new markets.4. The anti-Mr Beast strategy. Micro-influence > mass appeal. Small, loyal followings can be as powerful as large audiences. Creators with 10K real fans often make more impact (and money) than those with millions of passive viewers. Depth over breadth. Sleep better at night.5. The Elon effect. Fire 90% of your team and watch productivity soar. Elon did it at X, and it’s a masterclass in cutting dead weight. Most tech companies are just burning cash on mediocrity. It makes you think about your own companies. How much bloat is in your organization?6. Silent entrepreneurs.I met entrepreneurs who don't even have an X account quietly building empires. I call them virgin entrepreneurs—multi-million dollar businesses, zero social media. Focus on building, not broadcasting. Being silent has its advantages.7. Resurrection of old products. An Australian group covered an old Cranberries’ song “Linger” and got 100M+ views. Some old products are ripe to go viral with the right twist. Dust off forgotten ideas and give them new life.8. Brute force audience building. In 2007, I replied to every comment on my blog. It worked. Engage relentlessly and build a loyal audience brick by brick. Taylor Swift did it. I recently started replying to every YouTube comment. It works.9. Pay per outcome (PPO). The new business model, accelerated by AI driving costs down. If you can’t prove value, you don’t get paid. Industries ripe for disruption with a pay-per-outcome model. Compete with SaaS by going pay-per-outcome.10. Bullish on YouTube. TikTok’s potential ban will make YouTube hot again. New features like Shopify integration allow creators to monetize directly. Expect a wave of ecommerce & creator millionaires thanks to this integration.11. The Half-Life of virality. Viral sensations used to last months. Now, maybe days. More viral hits lose steam quickly. 12. Embrace \"being bad\". I’ve failed countless times, but each failure was a step toward mastery. Embrace the process.Resources for you:1) Frameworks for how to win on the internet: subscribe at gregisenberg.com (free to subscribe) 2) 5+ free cash-flowing startup ideas per week on my YouTube https://lnkd.in/ebpMJaHS (free to subscribe)",

I create content, people find me, and the product sells itself.”Me: “So, your customer acquisition cost is zero?”Him: “Basically.

Couldn’t ChatGPT do what you do?”Him: “Maybe, but the personal touch and the brand I’m building can’t be easily replicated. I also have a few FB Groups and WhatsApp communities that are super active.”Me: \"How do you learn to do all this?\"Him: \"Following people in the indie hacker movement. I had zero connections so just started following people building cool stuff online sharing in public?\"Me: \"Why don't you build in public\"Him: \"Copycats.\"Me: “Do you think you could scale this to $10M?”Him: “Absolutely. It's all about solving real problems and scaling what's already working. But even if it doesn't, it honestly doesn't matter.

    "content": "To me a startup unicorn isn't a billion dollar company. It's this:You find a VC-backed startup doing $5M ARR and burning cash. It's been around for 10 years, raised $20M, and based in SF. You swoop in, buy it for pennies on the dollar. Recap the company so the old founders/team have a stake in the new business. If you win, they win. Start hiring a global team, costs go down. Goodbye SF office space. Hello remote team in Latin America, Canada and Europe.You use AI and automations to make profitability go up even more. Every company is a media company, so you build organic customers through social and SEO. CAC becomes very close to zero. It feels good. The business starts scaling. That's when the dividends start piling up. You start writing checks to your team and partners. You watch as they buy houses and sailing on boats in the Mediterranean for vacation. You notice you sleep better at night. Something about a cash-flowing startup makes the REM cycle a little longer than when you were the CEO of a VC-backed thing.That to me is a unicorn.

    "content": "I learned something new the other day. There are indie Amazon Kindle authors making $200k+/month via EXTREMELY niche books.And they’re not just guessing what to write– they’re using secret data tools like \"Publisher Rocket\".Let's dig in.I learned this while talking to Dickie Bush and Nicolas Cole on today's episode of The Startup Ideas podcast Recently, entrepreneurs/authors are crushing it in underserved self-publishing niches. Cole dropped a gem of an example:The “lit RPG” (role-playing game literature) subgenre on Amazon Kindle. Top titles like “The Way of the Shaman” are pulling in $250k+ per month. Who knew?Readers devour these books faster than a power-leveling wizard, but the quality is like a Level 1 goblin.There’s a golden opportunity for a niche publishing company with better writing, cover designs, and branding to dominate “lit RPGs”.It got me thinking – what other untapped niches are out there waiting for someone to level up the content?Here’s how you can find out:Publisher Rocket:A data tool that shows estimated sales, search volume, and competition for any Kindle book or category. How it works:1. Scope Out Categories. Find estimated monthly sales and revenue for top books.2. Analyze Keywords. Check search volume and competition to find the \"competitive score\" for each keyword.3. Hunt Trending Niches. Look for high-demand, low-competition areas. This is the sweet spot.4. Reverse-Engineer Success.  Study top authors in the niche, their sales, and revenue.5. Data-Driven Creation. Craft a book for an underserved niche with explosive potential.Publisher Rocket is like having a secret agent in the Kindle store. Its an unfair advantage. I don't know how long this arbitrage will last. It’s a game-changer for finding what readers want, what's selling, and where the untapped markets are.But don’t stop there. It's about dialing in your audience targeting.Cole pointed out that women are the majority of fiction readers, but most lit RPGs cater to men. Not only is “lit RPG” an underserved niche, but female readers within it are also underserved.This strategy applies to any niche. Find an opportunity in vegan dessert cookbooks? Niche down to recipes for busy parents who need quick, healthy treats for kids.When hunting niches, look for overlooked audience segments. Then, leverage that IP for TV, movies, ecommerce etcEndless opportunities.Hope this was valuable. Comment/repost if it was.TLDR;They use data intel tools like Publisher Rocket to unearth:- Huge reader demand- Low competition- Untapped profit - Niche down further to unserved audiences (like female LitRPG readers).Take notes, all.Full episode is LIVE (plus other bonus cash-flowing startup ideas) below:https://lnkd.in/eS9rb5dXhttps://lnkd.in/eXyh8Zhshttps://lnkd.in/eUJMNz_K",

AI makes mistakes and human beings are all like \"that's cute\". But, if AI keeps growing (which it will), eventually it'll be more intelligent than human beings. Only a matter of time. How will 1 human being be able to win an argument against an AI that is connected to the entire world's knowledge?A major shift will happen...Human beings will play the role of the child and AI the role of the adult.

    "content": "I’ll tell you a story I haven’t told many people…I'm 18, bank account dwindling, and desperate for a job. I applied to 100 jobs and got zero offers. They said I didn’t have enough experience or my French wasn’t good enough. The hopelessness was real.So, I reached out to internet companies in SF/NYC.\"Hey, would you pay me $2/lead? No risk to you.\"It was 2008, during the great financial crisis. Companies were looking to cut costs, and this was attractive. Mobile/social was just becoming a thing. New apps needed users.The first few hundred emails were ignored. Finally, one company said yes. I made $100 that month. Not exactly balling out, but it was a start. I bought a pair of cool shoes with it. Sweetest shoes I ever bought.Every app needed users, and I knew how to get them. I could scale this. I hired two friends, trained them on the pitch, and paid them $1/lead. The margins were thin, but we started pulling in volume.One day, I found a goldmine—a venture-backed startup scaling fast. They needed users and had the budget.I pitched them: \"$2/lead? Let's scale to 1,000 leads a week.\" This was Zynga. They had just put out Farmville and were looking to grow users.They bit. Suddenly, I was making $2,000 a week. I dropped out of college.We experimented with Facebook ads, forum postings, and influencer marketing. The results were wild. Facebook ads were literally $0.05 per click!In '08, we built an iPhone app (before the App Store) to ping us every lead we generated. On my 18th birthday, it dinged every few secs.In 6 months, we were generating over 20,000 leads a month and running a mini lead-gen empire. I was still living at my parents' house.But the $$ wasn’t the most interesting part. We were learning skills that would be invaluable—growth hacking, community mgmt, copywriting etcFast forward to today, and I've built and sold multiple companies. But it all started with that $2/lead hustle during the worst economic downturn of our generation.Moral of the story:When the world goes to hell, look for opportunities. Innovate. Be relentless. Your big break might be just an email away.I felt pretty hopeless back then. But the cool part about the internet is the lack of gatekeepers.Not too long ago...- You had to get press to get customers.- You needed VCs to build a product.- You needed a degree to get that job.There was always a gatekeeperNot anymore. Tons of people sit on the sidelines. They aren't shipping.But it's not because they can't. They totally could. Especially with the cost of launching anything being so cheap. They just don't realize the gates have recently become wide open.It fires me up.So, stop waiting for permission. The gates are open. Just walk through. --Enjoyed this?

    "content": "Here’s a free billion-dollar startup idea for you. Reinvent Microsoft Teams or Slack...But, instead of charging $4-$8 per user, charge per message or per new channel.Enterprise messaging is a multi-billion dollar market, but it's broken. CFOs are tearing their hair out trying to cut costs. Employees get mini heart attacks every time they’re added to another channel. It’s chaos.Imagine this...fewer messages, fewer channels. Meetings are more productive, focus time is sacred, and companies save a ton of money. Everyone’s happier. The entire brand is about quiet and happiness. You make the logo a freaking bright yellow sunshine.All features are designed to be more productive. Maybe you even partner with productivity influencer like an Ali Abdaal or Tim Ferriss So, this idea of taking market share from Slack/Teams is top of mind right now. Some of my fav entrepreneurs are going after it.Jason Fried launched Campfire with a $399 lifetime deal. Amazing, but not everyone wants to host their own software. Too much hassle for most.David Sacks tried Glue AI, adding more features but sticking with the same old $7/month model. Competing on features is tough when you're competing against Slack. They've already shiped AI-powered search, conversation summaries and recaps.My last company was a group chat app. Competing with WhatsApp, Discord, and others in a feature race was brutal. Lesson learned for me:You never want to be in a feature race unless you have endless funding.Here’s the takeaway..Sometimes, it’s not about reinventing the product. It’s about changing the business model.Imagine the CFO of a mid-sized company discovering they can save thousands by switching to a pay-per-use model. No more per-user licenses. Teams are less distracted, more productive. The CFO will push for this. Teammates will push for it. That's how you build sales momentum.I hope someone takes this free idea... or at least finds another category and just flips the business model on its head.Agree or disagree with me?We can make the comment section a nice creative zone.And if you like startup ideas, click the youtube link below for ~5 free startup ideas per week.https://lnkd.in/ebpMJaHS",

    "content": "I saw so many typos in a creator's post recently. It went viral—millions of views. Typos everywhere.I let out a sigh of relief. I knew he didn’t use ChatGPT. Or did he?It got me thinking...If people think your content, copy, or designs were made by AI, you've already lost.Humans crave the human touch, authenticity, and the real deal. It's human nature.I'm starting to see brands use AI in a pretty tasteless way.The CMO thinks no-one can tell that those images were created by DALL-E or Midjourney. People can tell.AI is powerful. It can create, predict, and optimize. But it lacks soul. When your audience sniffs out AI, trust plummets. And that's pretty hard to regain.In the future, the best brands/creators will be those who master AI, not just use it. They'll blend tech and humanity so seamlessly that you can't tell where one ends and the other begins.But let's not forget, human creators can hit crazy scale without AI. I think of Moots, a high-end bicycle builder that handcrafts titanium bikes tailored to each rider's specs. They are the anti-mainstream bike and do $5M+ revenue per year. Very bespoke, made-in-the-USA bikes.My point is being human-made, not mainstream, is also an opportunity to create profitable businesses. When everyone is zigging, zagging is an equally good strategy.Prediction: we'll see an influx of \"human made\" products, content etc.And they might end up being even more profitable than the AI-first ones.Moots carved out a niche by being authentic and personal in a world of mass production.So here's my current thinking on this whole topic:Imagine a world where AI does the heavy lifting, freeing you to add the magic. That’s the sweet spot. But it's a fine line. Lean too hard on AI, and you risk becoming a faceless algorithm.Someone will respond to this and say:\"well, AI is going to get so good no one will notice\".I'm a/cc as the next Twitter person. But I believe humans will always play a huge role in the equation.Because ultimately we're selling to other humans.The winners of this era....They'll be the storytellers who use AI as a tool, not a crutch. They'll deliver human experiences enhanced by technology. Nail that blend, and you're unstoppable.The future of content: Come for the creator, stay for the typos.",

This IRL startup idea will get your creative juices flowing...Woman organizes trivia nights. She’s a 3rd party provider and bars/pubs/companies hire her to do trivia nights.She hires local comedians or local people with personalities to go to the bars/venuesShe prepares the materials and content. She charges on average $500 per event. Note: I think she could even do % of bar tab which makes this an even more \"no brainer\" idea for bars.Right now, she's doing about $27,000/month of revenue. She's got an EA that helps her part-time. Used AI to help with the content. Total profit is $23,000/month.Told me she organizes 10-15 a week.This could easily scale to other cities. Currently, she's just in 1 city.Bars are happy because seats are filled. They see $1k-$5k bumps in revenuePeople are happy because they are craving IRL community experiences like this post-COVID.Local entertainers are happy because they are getting booked and getting paid to do what they love.This woman is happy because she's making tons of money doing what she loves in a community she cares about.Wins all around.

Taste. Because knowing what’s beautiful matters.2. AI. Because understanding how to use the right agents/tools is an advantage3. Funnels. Because a good funnel can bring in $1M+/year4. Be a generalist. Because managing AI agents and human talent is high leverage.5. Know how to price accordingly. Because most people price poorly. Lifetime deals might feel good in the beginning but are tough to create a business around.6. Write well. Because the right copy drives impact. 7. Community management. Because IRL/digital events are the cornerstone of the best internet businesses.8. Zag when others zig. Because when you zag, there’s probably less competition.I saw people like Zuck and looked up to them. I still do. I wanted my life to change. That's why I moved.

Give away 0% equity to investors. Profit share with your team. This is building startups in 2024.You'll learn pretty quickly through your group chat, what's resonating. You can't hire a community manager to run it. You're the community manager.Your job is to figure out what this group chat wants, and go build it for them.Entrepreneurship nowadays is figuring out what's a group of people that are underserved, get them to follow your social account or join your group chat and pre-sell to fund your development.Then keep iterating to make them happier and happier.Over time, you charge more and more. And you create more and more impact.That's it.The \"lean startup method\" has evolved.It's gotten bare bones.

    "content": "I've built an 8 figure holding company with $0 of outside capital called Late Checkout. Today, I’ll share our playbook:Step 1: Find audienceWe focus on influential, high value customer audiences.We’re like the anti-Mr.Beast. Less glory but I’m okay with it.We get ideas for those on what’s trending on places like Reddit and X. We use automation and AI to get those insights quickly and clearly.We observe what’s beginning to take off. Write it down.And most importantly, we ask \"why now\".Our most successful businesses had a strong why now.We write these ideas in our idea pages within Notion.Review it weekly.Step 2: social accountInstead of building a product that we sell first, we begin with a social account.Counter-intuitive, I know.But our thesis is that distribution is harder than building a product.We look at what other accounts in the space are doing.And try to do the opposite. The opposite is an important point because you're trying to create \"scroll stopping\" content. If it looks like everything else, they'll keep scrolling. Tactically, that might mean going more visual. Or telling stories that aren’t told.We get good at finding that format.And only focus on 1 platform.Multiple platforms at this stage is a distraction.Step 3: grow accountWe wait until we get to 10,000 followers before we usually build anything.In B2B, if you have 10,000 followers, you're the Mr. Beast of your category.10,000 potential customers is massive.Each platform has unique ways to grow.We’re particularly excited about You Tube right now.The “hack” right now is longer form, more raw videos and posting daily.Step 4: Free communityPeople don’t want another community.But they do want value.We overload them with value in exchange for their email/number.What’s worked really well is creating communities around “challenges”.Example: Join the 90 day keto challenge.Best part of this step is having this group of customers tell you what to build.And if you don't want to build a community, that's okay.Build a bunch of lead magnets.Step 5: Build a productWe don’t spend more than 30 days to build a product.Start small.Sometimes we’ll partner with existing business here. Or incubate something very small with a leading founder who's been in this space before.This has worked well.Step 6: Product/market fit.Now, product/market fit starts hitting and high fives all around.Copycats come in. But it’s okay.We keep going. The community keeps telling us what to build.And we’ve got systems in places to build quickly, test, learn and make it beautiful.It compounds all of it. The audience, the community, the product.Step 7: the futureOnce the product is really at product/market fit.We start thinking about adjacent products. We either buy/incubate those.That's the basic playbook. Hope it was helpful.Tomorrow, I'm co-hosting a live workshop on finding your audiencehttps://lu.ma/05esbrvx",

    "content": "I was part of startups that raised billions of VC in my 20s in Silicon Valley and didn't make much money. Here's the story and why it matters to you:1. VCs tell you to dedicate your life to the business, but they take August off.2. VCs tell you that you need to go big or go home, but their business is a collection of many bets3. VCs tell you it's all about team, but it’s common to replace a founder/ceo.4. VCs tell you to be lean and agile, but they’ll drown you in cash if it means a big exit.5. VCs tell you to maintain a work-life balance, but smile when you send emails at midnight.6. VCs tell you to own your niche, but often nudge you towards mass markets before you're ready.7. VCs tell you to measure everything, but their decision to fund often hinges on intangible 'gut feelings'.Am I wrong? Be honest.Now, I don't think all VCs are the same, just like all entrepreneurs aren't the same.But the problem isn't in VCs, it's two things:1) Some businesses need venture funding to thrive. The SpaceX type businesses or Uber type businesses2) VCs aren't 100% aligned with founders (especially first time founders).Let me break it down.They are incentivized for you to grow valuation. And sell or go public one day.But if you get an M&A offer that might be life-changing for you and your family? They might say don't do it.That happened to me. I had an M&A offer that was life changing when I was 22 years old. I would return 3x the amount I raised. Not bad right?I brought the deal to my lead VC. And he wouldn't sign the paperwork.\"I'm not thinking big enough. Imagine what I can get in 5 years. Forget 3x, think 30x\".I'll write about that story in a future newsletter post (gregisenberg dot com).So, for most entrepreneurs, I say make your money doing bootstrapped. Support your family. Buy your first house. Retire your parents. Do whatcha gotta do.That \"makes a ding in the universe\" in a different way. It makes a ding in your universe.Don't be shy to share this.Let's have an honest convo about this.If you agree with me, here's some free resources for you:1.

I've owned equity in companies that have raised billions in VC and the stock ended up worth $0.The amount of venture capital you raised used to be a badge of honor.You’d hear about how much a company raised and you were ready to give them a giant pat on the back. Nowadays, when I hear someone has raised hundreds of millions of dollars, I cringe. Employees probably won't make a $1. That's the harsh truth.When founders say they've raised a small number with a great business, I’m impressed. When founders say they've raised nothing with a great business, I'm even more impressed.No dilution, no investor updates, no external pressure.People call companies that have hit the magical $1B valuation mark \"unicorns\" because of how dreamy it is to hit that milestone.I don't know about you but it feels like the tides are shifting. Cash flow > valuation.The real unicorns are the startups that have raised $0, small teams, generate $10M-$1B year of revenue, have brands people love and are cash machines.Usually, these founders have multiple products, multiple companies, multiple income streams.Sounds pretty awesome to me.If it does to you too, here's some free resources for you:1.

It’s changed the way I hire, buy businesses and sell services.When I put something on paper, I’m more likely to make a deal happen.1) Instead of sending an acquisition offer email to a founder, I send them a letter of intent (LOI).2) Instead of sending a job offer to a prospective hire, I send them a formal offer letter.3) Instead of sending a proposal to a client, I send them a DocuSign.In the midst of buying a business because I went from first convo to LOI in 24h. Founder loved it.Not sure the deal would have gone through if I didn't make it feel \"real\" so fast.Putting it on paper speeds up the entire deal-making process. And we all know how much time kills deals. You invite competition to compete or people just chase another shiny object, not your shiny object.Sure, paperwork scares people off. And I’ve certainly scared off my fair share of folks. And yeah, it adds more time to the process. But I’ve got some templated LOIs or proposals, I’ve started to use to make it pretty quick.Anyways - sharing in case this is fruitful to someone out there reading this.It turns out putting it on paper is a shortcut not talked about nearly enough.Don’t just think it, ink it—put it on paper.",

    "content": "I met with a founder who’s bootstrapped an impressive local newsletter media business that reaches millions of people per year and makes $5M/year of revenue. But, he was in rough shape due to recent changes in Instagram’s algorithm causing his traffic to plummet, and ad dollars have been harder to get since the good old ZIRP days. He wanted me to invest in his business and is raising some VC money to shake things up.We’re all guilty of this. We look at an industry, shake our heads and declare it \"dreadful\" - a lost cause, doomed to fail where time, effort and money go to die. But some of these “dreadful” businesses that most people try to avoid are the ones I’m honestly most excited about right now.The media business is a prime example of this. I was reminded of it the other day. And as the founder was explaining his challenges, he uttered the fatal words: \"media is a dreadful business.\" That's when I had to stop him in his tracks.Here’s my point of view: If you build a media business, you own a rare resource: people's attention. Which attention you own is \"your business.\" Monetize the right high-value audience, and you've got a beautiful business. And how you monetize that attention is also \"your business.\" Monetize correctly through subscriptions, paid community instead of ad dollars, and suddenly you've got a high-margin, high-impact model.The status quo of media business is to find advertisers and optimize around impressions. But the most interesting way to monetize media is to build your own internet products (marketplaces, SaaS, communities) and optimize around monthly recurring revenue.The reality is the most dreadful businesses just need to be reoriented to be beautiful ones. New business model, new distribution channel, attach a creator to it. The truth is, there are no dreadful businesses - only dreadful “status quo” mindsets. When you approach an industry with curiosity, creativity, and an unwavering belief that there's beauty to be found, even in the most seemingly bleak of landscapes, that's when the magic happens. After all, some of the most beloved, profitable businesses in the world started out being called \"dreadful.\" And these days we call those businesses cash machines.History is rich with examples of 'dreadful' industries reborn through innovation.Someone comes in and looks at it completely different.And it becomes a golden business.That fires me up.",

Some spend more money, some spend less. 3. Some will post about your brand 24/7, others are your one star reviews.4. Some are more influential in your niche, some aren't even in your niche.We talk a lot about our dream VCs, dream teams and not enough about our dream customers.Dream customers can turn a garbage business into a goldmine.

A must watch for anyone that puts creative work out on the internet.It reminded me that “perfection kills progress”.At age 10, MKBHD wasn’t the best tech reviewer on the internet. But that didn’t stop him.In the first 6 months of putting out videos, Marques had already posted 200+ videos.The guy was just unapologetically hitting publish on videos.And did you watch the intro to this video? I mean, that intro got me fired up, but it wasn't exactly a Scorsese film. Many of us get  lost in the “comparison trap”.You don’t start something because you don’t think you’re good enough.The reality is you aren’t good enough until you start something.Marques didn’t wait.He published his work.From the video: “I hope I get more subscribers if I upload great videos everyday”It turns out he did. 18M+ of them.MKBHD shipped 100 videos to get 74 subs.MrBeast shipped 100 videos to get 760 subs. PewDiePie shipped 100 videos to get 2500 subs. You get the idea.Hit publish first, get good later.You should sign up to gregisenberg.com to hear more stories like this.

    "content": "I kinda killed my podcast. RIP \"Where it Happens\". So, I’ve been doing a podcast for 2.5 years now. 110+ episodes and 1M+ downloads.It never felt right. Felt like every other interview show out there.Until, I started inviting entrepreneurs who are idea machines on. And i said forget the interview talk, let’s just jam startup ideas.You know, the stuff these people wish they could do if they had the time.That's when it started to be really fun. And these exceptional entrepreneurs were dropping plenty of  free startup ideas that could be big.I started to get DMs of people who took these ideas to build great businesses. That got me amped.So that’s the show. 100% ideas, 0% anything else.And I realized the “Where it Happens” name has always felt like a “tofu brand” to me.It doesn’t really stick out. Takes on the sauce of whatever is around it. Bland.So, I’ve renamed the podcast from Where it Happens to The Startup Ideas Podcast. Or SIP for short.If you’ve been a fan of the pod, enjoy free more startup ideasIf you're a new fan of the pod, you’re about to get your creative juices flowing.Enjoy the first episode with Kevin Rose So, my ask if I've given you any value of the year is to give this a listen this weekend.Spotify: https://lnkd.in/eXhrY4gsApple:https://lnkd.in/eSMe85cSYoutube:https://lnkd.in/e6jGa6Wmand if you ever go on youtube click below to subscribe the Youtube channel (takes a second and you'll get extra free startup ideas)YouTube subscribe:https://lnkd.in/ebpMJaHSSo, if you're anything like me, you're a startup idea junkie.This podcast is for you.My thinking is the more startup ideas out there, the better.The pie is big, let's eat.And take a SIP.Comment below what you think.",

    "content": "I met with a founder who’s bootstrapped an impressive local blog/newsletter media business that reaches millions of people per year and makes $5M/year of revenue.But, he was in rough shape. A few recent changes in Instagram’s algorithm and his traffic has plummeted. And ad dollars have been harder to get since the good old ZIRP days. I felt for him.So, he wanted me to invest in his business and is raising some VC money to shake things up.And as he was explaining all this, he uttered the fatal words: \"media is a dreadful business.\"That's when I had to stop him in his tracks.Here’s my point of view:If you build a media business, you own a rare resource: people's attention.Which attention you own is \"your business.\" Monetize the right high-value audience, and you've got a beautiful business.And how you monetize that attention is also \"your business.\" Monetize correctly through subscriptions, paid community instead of ad dollars, and suddenly you've got a high-margin, high-impact model.The status quo of media business is to find advertisers and optimize around impressions.But the most interesting way to monetize media is to build your own internet products (marketplaces, SaaS, communities) and optimize around monthly recurring revenue.The reality is the most dreadful businesses just need to be reoriented to be beautiful ones. New business model, new distribution channel, attach a creator to it.There aren't dreadful businesses, only dreadful outlooks.So yeah, I'm leaning into dreadful businesses.They have the least competition and most room to shake things up.When you apply new internet models to dreadful businesses, good things happen.",

    "content": "20 years of juicy startup & life knowledge in a few words:1. Everything is a drug. Coffee is a drug. Food is a drug. Business is a drug. Use accordingly.2. Google is a $2T biz walking around with their pants on fire because of AI. There's no guarantees in life3. Jargon almost never helps your case. The simplest sentences make things happen4. Avoid “trust me” people. Constantly the most untrustworthy people5. Why most products fail: not opinionated enough, wrong opinions, wrong community, distribution never figured out, giving up6. Bad copy kills businesses, good copy makes them. Elite copywriters are worth their weight in gold.7. There are three types of goals to hold sacred. Your someday goals. Your 1 year goals. Your daily goals. Everything else doesn’t matter.8. I used to think a low follower to followee ratio was cool. Now I think the opposite. Avoid people who play status games.9. More direct reports you have, the more stress you'll have. That's okay. Just acknowledge it.10. Nothing is out of reach. I remember that feeling, on the come up. Top people felts unreachable. They’re just like you.11. When someone uses your product, they are having a dialogue with you. It’s kinda spiritual. Will they understand your vision like you do?12. Find all your business partners from either people you grew up with or people you find fascinating on the internet, and nothing in between.13. How to hire: based on integrity, grit and how quickly (and willing) they are to learn.14. Cash-flow is king. Being dependent on anyone is always less than ideal. Zuck or VCs.15. If you want to write an angry email, wait 24h and see if you’d word it differently tomorrow. Hard to write good emails when you're angry16. Bad copy kills businesses, good copy makes them.17. The wrong customers will drive you crazy. Sometimes I’ll see a wonderful team and product, but they just focused on the wrong customers. So the business ends up sucking.",

And yes, those numbers are Canadian dollars ($1 USD = $1.36 CAD)I got lucky. I bought in 2020, and found a place that had natural beauty and was inexpensive.The payback on my professional life has been huge.- I get my best ideas in nature, disconnected from the hustle & bustle of Miami, NYC and SF.- I know that if all else fails, I can always retreat to that home. That makes me take more risks in my business. Since I've bought this home, my holdco went from $0 to 8 figures in revenue.And personally, it's a game changer.I grow blueberries in the summer, have a cedar sauna I use to unwind, make fires to keep warm and do the simple things in life with friends and family.Highly recommend.The hardest part is many people have to wait for another pandemic for an opportunity like this. But, I still believe there are pockets of beautiful places in this earth 90 minutes or less from major airports, worth investing in. Game changer.",

I got paid back my original investment in 6 months.It got me thinking...This is the golden era to buy a venture-backed business. Startups are going OUT OF BUSINESS left, right and center.They want to raise more VC, but they can’t. Raised too much in the ZIRP era and tons of VCs still on sidelines.They want to sell, but they can’t. Anti-trust and high interest rates are making big acquirers more cautious.They want to go IPO, but they can’t. There are 85% less IPOs in 2023 than 2021. The bar to IPO is sky high.So what’s going to happen?The amount of startups going out of business is skyrocketing.They either shut down.Or they sell for pennies on the dollar.Maybe that’s where you come in.You see, a lot of these businesses are great businesses.Some of these products areBut they’ve just raised too much capital.Many founders are just going to want to move on.There’s a whole new generation of founders who are going to buy businesses and turn them into holding companiesThis is how they’ll do it:Step 1: Acquire businesses at an attractive priceStep 2: Create internet distribution to scale customer baseStep 3: Build AI-assisted software to increase marginsStep 4: Recycle cash-flow to buy more businessesI did this 1.5 years ago.1) Bought 50% of http://boringmarketing.com, best SEO implementors on the planet2) Scaled Boring Marketer audience and community to 40,000+3) Built a suite of AI tools that makes http://boringmarketing.com unbeatable at SEO and helps get our margins to 50% 4) Using cash-flow to buy a new businesses (more on those soon)We were able to partner with the best team on the planet because to create a high-margin, asset light business.Even VCs I know want to talk to me about cash-flow businesses.Some are even getting involved on the size of their day-jobs.All of sudden cash flow is cool.Those \"boring\" internet businesses powered by audiences, community, SEO (cc @boringmarketer) are top of mind.And unlike VC-backed business (most fail, few win massively), there are tons of  \"middle class\" cash-flowing  internet businesses. Especially tons of AI wrapper ones.I see http://boringmarketing.com doing AI-assisted SEO for LOT of these profitable Internet businesses. They are EVERYWHERE.More and more folks will either snap these businesses up or start them.So, as the VC market starts to crack.It’s the golden era for buying. A way more surefire path towards wealth creation.I figured I'd share how I'm thinking about it in case it's valuable to someone.If it's valuable, share and let me know.Buying cash-flow companies is the NEW building venture-backed companies.",

If it was human only, the business would barely breakeven. AI-assisted will be more and more common.Made with AI will be a signal of cheap quality.Will \"Made with AI\" always be \"Made in China\"?Probably not.But as of now, it sure feels like it.",

    "content": "I’ve helped build internet communities that have generated 75M+ members & followers:The most often question I get asked is:How do I build a community from scratch?1. Why you should care about community:It's the best way to build a movementIt supercharges word-of-mouthPeople want community more now than everProducts built on top of communities scale fastStart small. Start tiny.2. 95% of communities can start as a simple group chat.A community only needs a shared purpose and a place to thrive. Don’t overthink it.Weak community leadership kills communities3. 6 qualities of high-performing community leaders I’ve noticed:1. Captivating2. Consistent3. Loud4. Obsessed with the mission/people5. Relentlessly helpful6. Sincere4. Invite-only works95% of communities should begin as waitlists. B2B or B2C. Doesn’t matter.Exclusivity and scarcity drives demandTip: waitlist communities outperform5. Merch supercharges communitiesYou’d be surprised what designing incredible merch can do to a communityIt gives them a “raison d’etre”Tip: hire streetwear designers to design your merch6. Get members where they want to goThe secret to community design: get members they want to go (ie: milestones etc)The best communities: move members7. Who we areI’ve never found a community that thrived that didn’t have a compelling “who we are” storyKey points:Describe the future utopiaDescribe the cause with passionAmplify the real reason they existTip: tighten your who we are story and terrific things happen8. Not all founding members are equalYour first members set the tone. Choose wisely. These are the aspirational members, the members people like being around, the members who will spread your message.9. Community/market fitFounders obsess about product/market fit. But don’t obsess enough about community/market fit9. Design ritualsBeing in a Zoom call together isn’t community buildingThe goal:Create daily/weekly rituals that make people feel alive and grateful to be a part of the communityTakeaways:1. Human beings can’t help it: we need to belong2. The long-term win is in building a community3. Building a community is where art meets science. It's perfectly do-ableI hope this was fruitful for you.

    "content": "My life got 10x better (relationships, career, wealth etc) when I removed these words from my dictionary:1. \"I don’t disagree\". There is nothing more lame than saying “I don't disagree”. You either agree or disagree or don’t know enough to commit. 2. \"Valuation\". Just because a VC tells you how much your company is worth doesn't mean much. I worked at WeWork when we worth $47B and now it’s bankrupt. Replace the word valuation with cash-flow.3. \"I’m so jealous\". Replace jealousy with inspiration. You see someone who is doing well, that’s inspiring. Even a stranger, clap loudly for them. Go them!4. \"Too small\". When i look back at the projects that have turned into something impactful, they’ve all started off “too small”. I guess there is no \"too small\" of a project. Markets mature, markets grow.5. \"Revenue\". Replaced with profit. Revenue never mattered as a measure to how a business is doing, profit always did. Revenue matters to them, profit matters to you.6. \"I'm so busy\". Replace this with \"I'm focused on what matters most.\" Being busy obviously doesn't mean you're being productive. 7. \"I'm stressed\" - Stress is a choice. Replace this with \"I'm taking it one step at a time.\" Focus on what you can control and let go of the rest. Letting go is freedom.8. \"I'm not lucky\". This is small-time thinking. Of course, people are going to be richer than you, better looking than you, more connected to you but it doesn't mean that you can win the game you're playing.9. \"I can't\". Replace \"I can't\" with \"How can I?\" This shift puts you in a problem solving mindset, so you overcome challenges instead of surrendering to them. You're about to get really creative to figure this out.10. \"It's all been done before\". Replace this with \"How can I add my unique touch?\" Originality comes from personalization, not from an untouched idea.11. \"That's just how it's done\". Who cares how it's normally done. The best ideas come from turning it on its head. Replace with \"What if there's a better way?\"12. \"Keep your cards close to your chest\". I used to cling to my ideas like secret treasures, fearing theft more than obscurity. But ideas in isolation wither. Sharing my craziest thoughts led to collaborations that turned pipe dreams into pipelines. 13. \"Scale fast or fail fast\". The Silicon Valley mantra. I chased growth like a high, only to realize I was scaling a house of cards. I raised from literally the world’s best VCs only to learn this the hard way. Sustainable scaling is an art form—it's about knowing when to push and when to pause. Sometimes, the fastest way up is to slow down and strengthen your foundation.If you disagree/agree with me, let me know.What else do you stop yourself from saying these days?-- If this resonated, you'll enjoy my post on my predictions in the tech industry (and where you can build profitable internet startups:https://lnkd.in/esvNmFfz",

    "content": "The REAL truth about bootstrapping vs venture-backed startups:When you raise venture and you’re the CEO, you’re still making $100k+ no-matter what. Realistically more. You know how long you'll be getting that cash for even if VCs decide not to fund you anymore (usually 12-18months). You've got baseline stress because you want to build something big. When you are bootstrapping and you are profitable, it's way less stress than running a venture-backed startup. You’ll taste real freedom and probably take home $500K+/year through dividends. When you are bootstrapping and unprofitable, it's way more stressful. Everything is on your shoulders. You're looking at creative financing like lines of credit and growth hacks to get you to profitability like your life depends on it.Your stress levels go down the more profits you make.I've got tons respect for both type of founders, but bootstrappers you earn an extra tip of my hat.-For more real truths about venture backed startups and bootstrapping, grab my weekly email at https://lnkd.in/ep3szJTF (and free startup ideas for you to start!)",

    "content": "I'M FEELING SPICY TODAY. I’ll say the quiet parts out loud for people into tech:1. Memecoins are gambling. What is the difference between going to a casino and trading memecoins?2. Corporate job security in is an illusion right now. Somehow it's more safe to be an entrepreneur with no health insurance than working at a mid-level job at Google.3. No-one is talking about how Discord opened up their platform for apps a few days ago. All of a sudden you have access to their 200M users. Fortunes will be made.4. The HEIC file format is a sham. If Apple had a heart, they would use JPEGs.5. AI will put hundreds of thousands out of work. When I scroll through X, I see people saying there’s zero chance that AI replaces jobs, arguing “It will make them more productive.” I don’t think so. It’s not rocket science. If they are more productive, there will be less need for people. Those people will have other jobs. Am I missing something here?6. People made fun of Mark Zuckerberg over the metaverse for like 2 years. Zuck was right. More and more interest in VR is coming from everyday people. More and more applications are becoming interesting. As soon as they stop looking just like “face computers,” that’s when it’ll take off. For now, reality is the ultimate “virtual reality.” Can we agree that Zuck was onto something with this metaverse thing?7. Creators become the next presidents and prime ministers. We saw reality TV stars and celebrities become presidents—Trump, Schwarzenegger etc. Soon, creators will be too. Ron DeSantis spent $6,831 for every vote he received this year. Wild.8. Every social app looks exactly the same. Like literally the same. It’s all short-form videos and algorithms optimized for time spent. There will be a breakout social app that looks nothing like what we’ve got going on right now and it's going to be glorious.9. VCs are in soul-searching mode. Founders are realizing they could bootstrap 99% of the startup ideas they have. 10. The average founder of a GPT wrapper company will make more money than the average venture-backed AI startup. The talent war among venture-backed AI companies is fierce. If you can keep your GPT wrapper startup really niche and under 5 employees, you’ll probably do well. ChatGPT is getting unbundled, and unbundled fast.11. ‘Clean’ has become the new ‘fat-free’—a marketing masterstroke. From food to cleaning products, this label has captured the hearts of health-conscious consumers. It’s not just about the quality of the products; it’s about the brilliance of branding.12. You’ll swap LLMs like you change your clothes. People think ChatGPT will be the next Google, but the reality is the next Google will be spread out among hundreds of LLMs.LMK where you violently agree or disagree with me.

    "content": "This is an IRS tax form of a recent business we started. 95% of the businesses we start look like this: We use audience to bootstrap customers.When we don’t have time to build an audience, we’ll partner with a creator. Give them a cut of the business.Then we’ll create a little community of the power customers. Sometimes it’s just an iMessage group or WhatsApp group.We limit who can come in. This is only for the people for the most excited audience members. Those who just are dying to be in a group of other like-minded people.Then we try to figure out what we can build for the community that they’ll pay for. What are vitamins versus painkillers? This is more art than science.They usually overload us with ideas. Some of them are painfully bad ideas. Some of them are painfully good ideas but hard to execute. Some of them are painfully good ideas but easy to execute (yessss).We add them the good ideas but easy to execute.Money starts flowing in. Word get out.Copycats come in. But it’s okay. That just means we are on the right track. No copycats, no validation.We keep going. The community keeps telling us what to build.And we’ve got systems in places to build quickly, test, learn and make it beautiful.Then you just gotta keep going.It compounds all of it. The audience, the community, the product.Once the product is really at product/market fit.We start thinking about adjacent products. We either buy or incubate those.This increases lifetime value of the customer.I'm pretty sure this model will be more and more attractive to people.You learn what to build for people pretty clearly. You're in HD mode when others are in black and white.And this model requires no VC, no rocket science ideas, just products, services and content that helps people.The best ones actually don't build overnight. They take 6+ months to start feeling like you're on the right track. Good things take time. I'm a believer.

    "content": "My rules for being a founder (after selling 3 companies):- Pay your invoices fast. People appreciate it- Recurring meetings are mostly useless- Your best internet ideas come when you are off the internet- Create products no one asks for but everyone wants- Remove the word \"valuation\" from your dictionary. Valuation doesn't matter. Add \"cash-flow\"- You need 1000 bad ideas to get to 1 good idea- Social posts are MVP V1, group chats are MVP V2, products is mvp v3- Avoid VC unless it's a competitive advantage or you're building deeptech, cleantech, AI chips etc- Be a rifle not a shotgun. Rifles are targeted, shotguns aren't. The internet rewards targeted products- Products are like airbnbs. The ones that get booked up the most are the unique experienced ones- Be a community billionaire. Meaning, create value with many micro-communities-Buy the ticket, take the chance. My best opportunities came from hopping on a plane to meet someone- We’re all in the trust business. Do things that make people trust you- Multiple products, multiple revenue streams in case something dries up- Freedom from venture, freedom from ads makes me happy. No bosses or micro-bosses- Do things to put you in the zone to come up with the ideas- Celebrate all wins, little and big- Be proud or what you're doing or don't do it- The best ideas are capital light, defendable, have network effects & increased demand- You can take over your world not the world. Gotta start somewhere niche- If you can turn your jealousy of others into inspiration of others, you instantly become more productive- Don’t lose money monthly, make cash flow- Google Trends/Reddit is a goldmine for startup ideas- Be on time, send cal invites, do the little things- Whoever is latest to the meeting pays for the coffee, food, drinks.- Create the things you wish existed- The most important decision you can make on any given day to be productive: ignore the noise- \"You can get what you want - if you help enough other people get what they want.”- Every sale has some urgency. No urgency, no sale- Never care what others think unless it's a loved one- Sometimes you need to overdose on caffeine, put some headphones on and ship your heart out- Every startup you start ask yourself what's your unfair advantage. You'll need one- The best products don't necessarily win, the best brand does- I find all my business partners from either people I grew up with or people I find fascinating on the internet, and nothing in between.- Find true fans. “10 people who yell make more noise than 10,000 people who are silent”- You’d be surprised how many startups spend millions of dollars a year of other people’s money trying to scale a business without an offer that resonates.- TikTok reviewers are the new search engines.If this resonated, I send out more stuff like this at https://lnkd.in/eVpHXj9F (takes a few seconds to subscribe)",

    "content": "How to write good copy for the internet (a guide). Bad copy kills businesses, good copy makes them.I think we’re entering an era where the best products don’t necessarily win, the best copy does.Most people write copy like they are writing instruction manuals.They got lost in explaining how the sausage is made and no one cares.And even worse they use that same robotic copy in the content they create.1. Paint a pictureMake your reader see, feel, and believe in the world you're describing as if they're living it. It's like telling a story that they become a part of.2. Conversational toneWrite like you're chatting with a friend. It should feel easy and friendly, making your reader feel right at home.3. Use line breaks generouslySpace out your sentences like breathing spaces in a conversation. People don't have time to read dense paragraphs when you are competing with TikTok. 4. Hone in on a single focal pointKeep your message tight around one big idea. It's like using a spotlight in a dark room to show off the most important thing.5. Shows credibility with examplesUse real stories or examples to prove your point. It's like showing a picture to prove you've been somewhere cool.6. Anticipates concerns and works through objectionsThink ahead about what might bother your reader and talk it out. It's like answering their questions before they've even asked them.7. EntertainingKeep things fun or interesting so your reader enjoys reading. It’s like adding a dash of spice to make a meal tastier.8. Know who you’re trying to reachWrite for someone specific, like you know exactly who they are, what they like, and what they need. It’s like picking out a gift for a friend.9. Show how the product worksExplain how things work in simple terms. It’s like explaining a game so everyone can play.10. Has clear calls-to-actionBe clear about what you want your reader to do next. It’s like giving clear directions so someone doesn’t get lost.11. Don’t be a robotPut some personality in your writing. It’s like wearing your favorite outfit instead of a uniform.12. Be different than your competitionStand out by being yourself. It’s like choosing to dance to your own music when everyone else is dancing the same.13. Use positive wordsUse words that make people feel good and hopeful. It’s like smiling through your words.14. Avoid exclamation pointsUse them sparingly. It’s like not shouting in a conversation.15. Clear and conciseKeep it short and sweet. It’s like telling a story without adding unnecessary details.16. Safe copy is risky copyDare to be different. It’s like taking a new path through the woods instead of the worn trail.17. Be interesting, be braveWrite something that grabs attention. It’s like telling a story that no one wants to end.18. Every word mattersChoose your words carefully. It’s like picking out just the right ingredients for a recipe.I hope this guide has been helpful.",

These are the same people who were trying to create VC-backed unicorns in 2020/2021.Now they want no hype, just a portfolio of businesses that pay them while they sleep.I think this is a trend that continues to grow because people are seeing more examples of this type of entrepreneurship.It isn't unrealistic to create a business that pay you $2-3M of free-cash flow in 24 months or under.We did that with boringmarketing dot com.Built an audience talking about AI-assisted SEO.Built a tool that helps people get customers via SEO. And it's gone viral.More customers than we know what to do it.A $2m-$3m FCF business is a wonderful \"lifestyle business\".I wonder what VCs think about this movement towards cash-flowing internet businesses.Do they feel threatened?Are they excited?Will we see more VCs look more like private equity and take part of this movement?",

It’s impossible.B2C or B2B. Nerds are critical.In a world where products all kinda feel the same. The nerd is your shepherd. Your atlas.You need a garden of nerds. I sure do. It's all I'm thinking about right now.The multipreneur blueprint:1) Find a nerd or be the nerd to gain insights2) Create a niche internet audience to gain attention3) Convert to a community (IRL, digital) to gain email addresses4) Ideate startup ideas with community to gain validationThen you move from the solopreneur to multipreneur stage.I’m not hating on solopreneurs but I think a multipreneur is less stress, more upside.Once you hit ~$100k/profit per year, that's when you earn the right to start thinking about it.Multipreneurship blueprint phase #21) Put systems, process and AI to gain operational excellence2) Hire yourself out of your role to gain the space to think about new ideas 3) Find more nerds to gain more insights (or be the nerd yourself)Bill Gates famously said:\"Be nice to nerds. You might end up working FOR one.\"I’d take it a step further, Billy....Be nice to nerds.

    "content": "If I was trying to build a $1M+ per year cash-flow business in 2024, here’s a few areas I’d consider (and how I'd do it):1. The wholesalification of SaaS (think Costco)SaaS is about to see an explosion of new startups. They'll offer the same (if not better) services at lower prices. SaaS is hitting its own Costco phase.I call it the \"wholesalification of SaaS\".Thanks to AI, copying a software product is almost becoming free. So, why stick to Slack when there's a more wallet-friendly option out there?Take Zoho, for example. They've mastered the art of taking hit SaaS products and selling them for less.$1B ARR with 50 products, 15,000 employees, 100M+ users, is probably worth $50B based in India (far from Silicon Valley) and never raised $1 from anyone. Goals.How to do it:1. Make a list of vertical software companies2. Prioritize by need and lifetime value of customer3. Clone yet create beautiful brand, copy, design, community4. Offer product at 50%+ less5. Consider new business models like one time payment or pay-per-task instead of monthly subscription (due to subscription fatigue)2. Buying distressed VC assetsLately, I've been pouring a lot of my time into scooping up VC-backed businesses that are hitting a wall when it comes to raising their next round. With capital becoming a rare commodity and the funding frenzy of 2020-2022 now a memory, there's a goldmine of opportunities out there.The truth is, many of these VC-funded ventures could turn into real cash cows without the high-flying expectations that come with venture capital.You don't need to be a genius to pick up one of these businesses and transform it into a lucrative and fulfilling entrepreneurial adventure.How to do it:1. Scour ProductHunt for interesting startups that launched a few years ago2. Pick a niche you think you have an unfair advantage inMake a database of the founders of the most interesting businesses3. Cold DM them on Twitter. Be honest. Tell them you’re interested in buying their businesses and curious if they’d be open to chat4. Self-fund the acquisition or raise money once you have the deal secured3. MembershipsMemberships are the latest evolution of internet communities, adding a fresh twist by integrating a monthly fee in exchange for access to software, educational content, services, and more.It’s like enterprise software like MRR without having to invest in building a technology startup. I predict more creators and internet audiences will adopt memberships. How to do it:1. Pick a niche category you have an unfair advantage in2. Map out the customer journey to see what value you can add3. Pick a name that’s catchy and interesting4. Start a free community on WhatApp, FB Groups, Skool etc.5. Upsell to paid membership6. Partner with software companies to offer free software/discountsThe full post to see 5 more profitable spaces: https://lnkd.in/e8uPZKTp",

He has raised $3.5m in VC funding.There’s a bunch of people who should shut down their startups (or sell them) but don’t.How do I tell him he should quit?He started the business with a full head of hair. The guy doesn't have 1 hair left on his head.And I know he's pretty stressed running this \"zombie company\".The business is growing enough to make him feel like he's on the right track and not enough for him to raise follow-on financing.I get his investor updates and no-one responds. I bet most VCs wrote off the investment long ago.He goes:\"If I only get to $5M ARR, I can raise that big round and take a big swing\".Yeah, maybe.But sometimes the hard way isn't the right way.Not everyone needs to be Mark Zuckerberg or Elon Musk.You can still create value in this world by creating businesses that are profitable, provide dividends to your team and yourself.Cheaper and more profitable ever to do it right now. You don't necessarily need VC.We don't talk enough about zombie companies. There're everywhere.And sometimes starting fresh is freedom.It's a new world out there.--More stories like this if you sign up to my newsletter gregisenberg.com",

It's all or nothing, baby. You either hit it out of the park, or you go down swinging.2. Location is king. Want to make it in tech? You best be in Silicon Valley.Fast forward to now, and things are looking a bit different.We've shifted gears into an era of multi-entrepreneurship - a space where moonshots and single-mission startups are making way for more diverse portfolios.We've become \"multipreneurs\".Multipreneurship 101:1. Diversified Risk: Multiple ventures = multiple safety nets. Spread your chips and build resilience.2. Creator aligned: Creators are the new entrepreneurs. Marry their creativity with your venture, and gain access to their audience.3. Community Currency: Communities are the future. Grow them, serve them, and they'll become your strongest brand advocates.4. Exponential Learning: Each venture is a lab. The lessons learned in one fuel the growth in others.5. Cross-Pollination: Use the momentum from one venture to propel the others. Success breeds success.6. Controlled Destiny: Don't rely on VC whims. Run a profitable business and control your destiny. Prioritize EBITDA, not selling preferred stock!7. Personal Growth: Juggling ventures is tough, but it pushes your limits. It's not just financial growth, but personal evolution.8. Silicon world: It's not about being in Silicon Valley anymore, the true multipreneur leverages social to go fast.Bottom line?You don’t need to go big or go home anymore — you can go big from home.Multipreneurs will sell their companies for 7-8-9 figures, go IPO or just live lives with freedom. They'll never go back to venture-backed land.Prediction:Today, kids want to be YouTubers. Tomorrow, they'll want to be Multipreneurs.--First step to being a multipreneur, is understanding how to build internet audiences and communities.

    "content": "Here are the 6 questions I get asked the most (from building wealth to learning new skills):1. How do I go from zero to 10,000 followers on social?The fastest way is through comments & replies. You literally don't need to post content of your own. Here's the playbook:1) You make sure your bio is optimized2) You set tweet (or IG etc) notifications for people in your space3) You comment thoughtfully on their posts quickly4) You gain a few followers daily5) You do this consistentlyThis is the sure way to getting a base of followers in a niche.You can't lose.2. Where do you see content going in 2024?Content has been over produced over the last few years and it’s about to go more raw. Especially video. The trend with short form video has been every second amplified with sound effects and zoom ins. Price dings and GIFs. I think you’ll see more creators go raw and see lots of luck there. Examples include Sam Sulek or this handwritten photo I included in this post.Content is moving behind the scenes.3. What was biggest lesson learned from selling your company to WeWork and being at WeWork at the height of craziness?When I joined WeWork, something stood out. People referred to \"adam\" in an almost god-like way. They were referring to Adam Neumann.It was fascinating to see on a dime how thousands of people went from worshipping Adam to despising him. He went from god to enemy overnight.Employees thought their stock options were worth millions and ended up being pretty worthless. Teaches you a lot about human nature.4. How would you make $1m or $10m in 2024 if you had to and only had $25k to do it?Firstly, good things take time. Figma (now worth $20b) took 7 years to reach $1m in revenue. Things move slowly until they move fast.But if I had to make $1M, I'd follow the ACP funnel (audience, community, product) to build an asset light, profitable business targeting a niche I probably found on Reddit.So, I'd pick a unique category, something where I'm not competing with anyone. I'd build a social account (partner with creators to pump it with the $25k), convert into a free community to get their emails and build them a product. The product probably would start be a lightweight software product or paid community.5. What's your best advice for how to win on the internet?1) Have a bias for action2) Ignore noise3) Be obsessed4) Accept pain, don’t suffer (pain is inevitable, suffering is optional)5) Find cheerleaders. People above you, people below you, people on your level6) Don’t follow growth hacks. If someone is telling you about them, it’s too late7) Don’t trust public revenue numbers on LinkedIn etc. They are probably false8) Your brand should be so good people want to wear it on t-shirts. I call it the t-shirt test6. How do you learn new skills?1) Limit scope (focus)2) Write learnings every day (memory)3) Learn with others (accountability)4) Teach newcomers (practice)",

    "content": "Adobe abandoning its $20b acquisition of Figma got me thinking...Man, it's tough to be a VC-backed founder.You create one of the most game-changing products, Figma.Millions of people use and love it. Every designer looks up to you.You get a $20B offer. Finally, after 11 years of starting the company, you see that financial payoff.And then all of a sudden, some regulatory body in the UK says “no bueno”.Crazy part is, you’ve never even been to London and you don’t like tea very much.You’re more of a California guy.So, deal is off.This is the new reality of VC-backed founders.It’s IPO or bust for the most part.I think lots of founders and soon-to-be founders will look at this and ask themselves:Why would I go the VC route?The path to liquidity is tough. Yeah, maybe you can sell some secondary shares in a Series A or B.But also, you’re reliant on VCs to make that happen for you. Are you really in control of your destiny?This is more headwinds for the profitable, bootstrapped movement. Solopreneurship, multipreneurship, bootstrappers, call it what you want.You answer to no-one but yourself.You’re business might not be worth $100b but you can build a $1B business without VC.You probably won’t go to mars, but you can make it to the moon.Another trend:You’ll also see more and more people raise capital and issue dividends.Profit sharing.I saw 2 deals this week of founders raising money on a YC safe note but issuing dividends.It was music to my ears.And I bet music to theirs too.It might not look like it but I believe this to my core:It’s a beautiful time to be building internet businesses.--I put together a free 5 day course on building internet businesses powered by audiences over here communityempire.coI also have a free guide of the 6 tools I use to get endless startup ideas at gregisenberg.com/6toolsHope its helpful.",

    "content": "Today is my birthday.When I turned 30, I rented a massive house on 50 acres in Joshua Tree and invited 30 of my best friends (see photo).Celebrity chef cooking us meals to rare Mezcal from a town I'd never heard of. It was amazing. But today, I turn 35 and I'm doing it differently.My highlight?I'm going to Cheesecake Factory for dinner. Probably order a diet coke. Can't wait.I'll be with my wife and parents and might meet up with  a friend of two.When you get older, you realize the simple things are way more enjoyable.This is how I think about it:The pizza that's \"the best\" is often not the pizza with everything on it. Tomatoes, pepperoni, truffles etc.It's actually the margherita pizza that's the most beautiful. The perfect ratio of sauce, cheese and delicious dough.Not overwhelming, just simple.Maybe this off brand, because I talk about how you can use the internet for your dream life. But, my realization is the older you get, the more you realize your dream life is a lot different than how you dreamt it will be.It's a lot less of \"bigger is better\" and more realizing smaller is actually better in so many ways.And once you can narrow in on your \"small life\", you can use the internet to make your small life as big as possible.Make sense? It's starting to make sense for me...",

    "content": "I’m saving 2+ hours per day with a fridge magnet. It has one button with one purpose: to save me from my phone addiction.It’s called a 'Brick' and I'd never heard about it until 3 weeks agoWith the press of a button, this little square lifesaver blocks my phone from being more than a phone.No more apps, distractions, or unnecessary functions (other than those you allow).Genius, right?I stick it on the fridge while I’m working.It’s a physical reminder that sometimes, to lock in focus, you need to lock out distractions.To unblock my phone, I have to walk to the kitchen and push the button.And every time I'm tempted, I pause and ask myself:“Do I really need this?”Small friction, HUGE impact.There’s a billion-dollar industry for products like Brick saving us from ourselves. And it stretches beyond the digital detox space.The reason is simple:The world doesn't just need more products — it needs smarter solutions.Brick isn't for everyone.It solves a specific issue for people like me wanting to tame distractions and reclaim focus.It’s a ‘Fiji product’ — an island off on its own without any competitors, focusing on highly specific problems faced by a niche audience.Compare that to “New York products” — broad solutions for mainstream problems, crowded and competitive. Things like productivity apps and consumer social apps.In business, we often default to New York thinking. How can we serve THE MOST people possible?But trying to be everything for everyone rarely works.So what's the takeaway?If you’re building something new: find your 'Fiji'Find that super specific problem a passionate community is facing and solve it like nobody else has.You want to create a product so fitting, so perfect for its audience, that it becomes indispensable. And like Fiji, it's far away, far from competition and is viewed as non threatening by big incumbents.I'm experiencing this firsthand with my Brick (not affiliated in any way btw).More than a fancy fridge magnet, it's a gateway to better habits and a more focused life.It's 'Fiji' through and through — offering an uncommon solution for a specific problem. And I can't see Apple or Adidas building a competitor.The world is overflowing with 'New Yorks’Let's build more 'Fijis’",

It’s the longest “hellllll yeahhhhhh” I’ve heard in a long time.Interviewer: “Do you consider yourself a great guitarist?”Frank Zappa goes on to spill the secrets to building any lovable product.→ “What I do on a guitar has very little to do with what other people do on a guitar.\"Mic drop. Imagine ignoring everything and everyone else when building your product.It’s a reminder that the internet rewards uniqueness, weirdness.AI makes anyone able to spin up software, Hollywood style videos on a dime.That \"weirdness\", the human touch is what communities will gravitate to more than people think.Cookie cutter = products, content that looks like everyone else fueled by AIMolding your own clay = building the \"anti-product\" that looks and feels differentThis line is beautiful:→ “It's a game, you have a piece of time and you get to decorate it.”I can't stop thinking about that line. Being original, having fun with the time to build product, create content. The internet is a game, and you can decorate it how you want.Maybe that sounds corny but it's true.That's my energy for this year. Maybe yours too.--Btw, these are the questions I get asked the most.

Open up Twitter.Replace Twitter/X with LinkedIn, Instagram, TikTok, or any platform, and you might see a bit of yourself in me.So, I decided to pull a Houdini, make a radical shift. Recently, I've implemented a new game plan.Enter the \"The Two Coffee Rule\", a spin on the cheat-day concept, only it's for social media.I drink two coffees a day—one in the morning and another in the afternoon. During these caffeine highs, I indulge in Twitter—post, engage, explore trends, and absorb information.It's a contained 20-minute frenzy that aligns with my coffee intake and gets those creative juices flowing. But when the coffee runs out, so does my Twitter time.And you know what?The results have been game-changing. → Lower FOMO → Increased original projects→ And less of that competitive social rat race. My productivity? Skyrocketed.The Two Coffee Rule isn't just about controlling social media usage.It's about reclaiming your focus and creativity.Watch what happens when you don’t let push notifications push you around.Spoiler alert: good things--These are the 14 questions I get asked the most.

    "content": "This month, we had our 2024 kickoff exec offsite in Miami and I have some notes to share with you.10 lessons from our offsite building out our 8 figure holding company:-Lesson 1: Don't build a business that can't reach $10M+/year of cash-flow somehowSure, you can have some micro-businesses that chase smaller profits or businesses that have alternative goals like credibility or just learning, but asking yourself how this business can get to $10M+/year of cash-flow is a good brainstorming prompt.-Lesson 2: The best startup ideas are painfully obviousWe spent several hours brainstorming an idea in a space we liked.After hours of painfully trying to figure out what to build, we realized that our best ideas came to us pretty quickly.-Lesson 3: The F&G Framework for businessWe look at each business from a fulfillment and growth perspective→ Fulfillment = are customers getting an exceptional experience?→ Growth = are we attracting and converting strangers into customers at a clip we like?It’s a simple framework to figure out how the business is going.-Lesson 4: Don't build the software, then build the communityStart with the community, then build the software.Late Checkout’s operating thesis: build community before building the product. Keep your operating thesis near and dear.-Lesson 5: The best product hires come from gaming or consumer socialThey know how to get people to do things on digital products.Our best product hires weren’t ex-Meta or Google. They had experience building zero-to-one.Often they were ex-consumer social or gaming. Those people were most likely to be 10x-ers. even on B2B SaaS and they were B2C consumer social.-Lesson 6: If something is sold out, customers want it 10x more.It's human nature. This lesson is self-explanatory.-Lesson 7: 90% of minimum viable products can be created in 24h or less.Yeah, you heard me right!! 24h!We’ve built several 7 figure businesses in under 24h.Pretty crazy to think about. But giving your team constraints on MVPs is critical.Your MVP is probably more complex than you’d care to admit.-Lesson 8: Once you have product/market fit, two main efforts become scale & diversify.Scale so your business can reach its potential. Diversify in case one revenue channel starts drying up.Sometimes this requires separate teams.-Lesson 9: If you have to ask if you have product market fit, you don’t have it.Period.-Lesson 10: Find cool places to do your offsite.We got an airbnb. It wasn’t crazy expensive. $750/night, 6+ bedrooms. That's $125/room, way cheaper than a hotel. But it was super cool. On a river. Something memorable. Had a few kayaks etc and a huge pool.More memorable offsites in 2024. They work especially if you don't just brainstorm, you make decisions.The best creative ideas rarely come from staring at a screen.I'll share more takeaways from my offsite in the coming weeks/months on http://gregisenberg.com (give it a quick free subscribe)",

    "content": "Here are 30 realizations that changed my life as an entrepreneur:1. Startup valuation is literally a made up number.2. It's impossible to work with people who don’t answer texts within 24h.3. The internet can be your lottery ticket or your prison sentence.4. If Abercrombie & Fitch can rebrand (up 285% in 2023), then you can rebrand too.5. Having an internet audience is still wildly underpriced.6. Build products that no one asks for but everyone wants.7. It's actually a good idea to be poor in your 20s and reinvest everything in yourself (learnings, travel, network, figuring out who you are).8. Google is probably not going to “copy your startup”.9. Content is your salesperson that works for you 24/7.10. Look for opportunities that are low status now, but probably high status in a few years.11. Lifestyle businesses are still massively underrated. You can often turn them into non lifestyle business if you want.12. Avoid dependency on anything. Social apps, VCs etc. Freedom is two words: self-sustaining.13. Taking a break doesn’t mean you’re lazy, burn out is real.14. Whatever you do, don't be mid-curve.15. The only things that should change your mood are things that will change your life.16. Copycats are a nuisance, not killers. They are usually mosquitoes, not sharks.17. Good design can’t fix a poor product. But good design can multiply a product that’s working.18. People follow a journey, not a social account.19. If you’re doing stuff you hate, you aren’t rich.20. Don't create a startup without a \"why now\".21. Strangers don’t want to hear about you. They want to talk about themselves or better themselves.22. The best negotiators talk 10% of the time, and listen 90%.23. Good things happen when you add value to people’s lives through content & community.24. You could learn a lot about someone by their likes on X/Twitter.25. First find the niche, then learn from the community, then the startup idea will come to you.26. On hiring: if it isn’t a hell yeah, it’s a hell no. Never compromise for fit.27. Startups never go according to plan. There is no real plan for startups, only a direction.28. The best businesses are the ones that look like a movement. It needs to be an identity, not a product.29. Your identity is never your company ever. Your company is your business.30. Change scenery 2-3x per day to be extra creative.What are some realizations you've had as an entrepreneur, creator, maker, etc?Btw, recently, i went to Japan (for the first time) and I had some MORE realizations as a founder. You can check them out here for free. Enjoy. https://lnkd.in/eJZ4rQKZ",

    "content": "How to build a company in 2024 (with no investors):Short form video + newsletter + community + productsWhy start with short form?Algorithms are hungry for them. Feed them what they want.If this post had a video instead of an image, it would probably reach 2-3x more people.Video is the single greatest storytelling medium we have.People are 10x more likely to be connected to you from consuming videos than a few words.Note: the most exceptional short-form video creators, are some of the best writers I've ever met. They write beautiful scripts in their sleep.So the tip is to start with a platform like X or LinkedIn to become a good writer and then evolve to video.Once you're getting attention with short form, a newsletter builds that relationship (and you get an email address). This is the Morning Brew stage of your business.You can also create a free community to nurture and build trust.But 99% of these fail.The best free communities (digital or IRL), have rituals, education and entertainment.A paid community can be a monthly subscription for power customers. But only build this when you've proven out PMF with your free community.It's not uncommon to build a $10k-100k/month paid community in B2B. By the time you've built an audience, newsletter, free community, paid community, you probably know what product you need to build.This is where you're building serious enterprise value.This is your retirement plan. This is your 401k. I call it 401C (401 community).But maybe the biggest takeaway of all of this is it's probably time to get your ideas out there.Getting LOUD on the internet is still somehow undervalued.You don't need a big team, don't need VCs really.This is your roadmap to build your empire.--Note: I just published a free 5 day email course to build your community business empire, grab it here: https://lnkd.in/eWnVfCT8Oh, and for all the tools/playbooks you need to build your empire, consider joining our paid community to make the most of your 2024: https://lnkd.in/eURBvTdZHave an awesome week.",

    "content": "I'M FEELING SPICY TODAY. I'll say the quiet parts out loud:1. I wish I enjoyed opening Notion. Am I the only one who finds it slow and clunky?2. AI is bleeding customers. The consumer experience needs to be as addictive as swiping on TikTok or IG. Until that’s fixed, you won't be seeing AI everywhere.3. Dividend startups are going to become a big thing. Raising money in exchange for future profits. The reason is simple. VCs have slowed investment pace. Private investors are looking for cash flow. Founders are looking for cash.4. There is nothing more lame than saying “I don't disagree”. You either agree or disagree or don’t know enough to commit.5. Everyone talks about “the greatest wealth transfer in history” with boomers retiring and not talking enough about how the greatest wealth transfer will be scooping up distressed-VC assets which is happening literally as we speak.6. The newsletter bubble is about to POP. It doesn't make sense for a person to subscribe to 10+ emails. Something is going to break. 7. A viral post can change your life. It has mine. But it's basically a casino. Luck is involved. But it's more poker than it is roulette.8. SaaS apps with 100% AI-written code will unbundle vertical SaaS. 0.4% of SaaS companies achieve $10M ARR. 4% of SaaS companies achieve $1M ARR. The less than $1M ARR companies will be “eaten” by AI-written, more bespoke looking SaaS apps.9. I’m excited for the Apple Vision Pro but it’s probably the most uncool looking Apple product yet. It looks like an accessory for the ski hill.10. The right 10,000 person audience on social is enough people to make enough money from for a lifetime. You don't need more than that. 11. Everyone always talks about cold plunges and saunas. Steam rooms are underrated with similar effects. Where my steam room people at?12. If the majority of their revenue is coming from courses, beware what they say.13. We’re moving from software as a service to software with a service. SaaS companies will have service arms with them to implement and customize. The future of SaaS is software as service + service as onboarding/customization + media as distribution.14. Most successful solopreneurs are high paid freelancers. Many will burn out and hire teams so they can scale and go on vacation.15. The size of the software market will 10-100x too due to AI being easy to create spin-up software.16. Don't build a newsletter business, build a newsletter powered by the newsletter. Buy a newsletter business for 1-2x revenue. 2x the revenue by turning a newsletter business into a business powered by a newsletter.17.

    "content": "I figured out a playbook to make products grow REALLY fast in 2024 (especially SaaS). Silicon Valley is sleeping on thisIt's the same playbook that Alex Hormozi is using and why he wrote the BIGGEST check of his LIFE last week into a startup called SkoolMy 3 realizations:#1 - Attach the RIGHT creatorNot all creator partnerships are created equal.Hormozi & Skool are perfect for each other because of WHO his audience is and WHAT the product does.I’ll call it what it is…his audience is mostly people trying to get rich.So, if he can find a product that enables them to do what they want. That’s the sweet spot.Skool allows anyone to start a community + membership.So, his audience can hop on, charge a monthly fee and spread via social.This is the important part.It helps get his audience where they are trying to get to.The right creator partnership isn't the biggest creator.It's the creator partner that if ONLY they used your product... they'd accomplish their goals way quicker.This creates the top of the funnel.#2 - Attach a GENEROUS affiliate cutMany startups have an affiliate program, but they need to 2x the payout and need a free trialIf you refer someone to Skool to start a community/membership (cost is $99/month), the person who refers get 40% of the referring fee.This takes the Alex Hormozi or creator flywheel and multiplies it like crazy.Creator partnerships without a strong affiliate program is a salad without the salad dressing. And the key is a free-trial with it.Make it easy for the second order followers to \"buy\" into the ecosystem even for free.# 3 - Make it FEEL like a gameLet's talk about how Skool probably added $30M of enterprise value in a few days thanks to a game.It’s not enough to have a creator, have a generous affiliate program, have a free trial in 2024.You need to make it feel like a game.Example:Hormozi announced Skool Games a few days ago.How it works:The more people you refer to Skool, the higher you move up on the leaderboard. Prizes include hanging out with Hormozi IRL in vegas and getting access to behind-the-scenes content.2600 joined in the last few days. Each who pay $99/month for a Skool subscription to participate in Skool Games.Imagine that.  Let's do some quick math.That's $99 x 2600 = $257k of MRR added in a few daysThat’s $3M+ ARR. Not unreasonable to suggest that Skool probably added $30M of enterprise value to Skool at a 10x multiple.To summarize:How to create grow a product (especially SaaS)1) Attach the RIGHT creator (top of funnel)2) Attach a GENEROUS affiliate cut with a free trial3) Make it FEEL like a gameHappy weekend!-Quick update:I'm buying Skool subscriptions $99/month for people who join my paid membership. https://lnkd.in/eURBvTdZJoin to ask me private Q&A every few weeks, monthly email on on startup ideas worth building, live events with people like Andrew Wilkinson etc. First come, first served",

    "content": "I ran a little experiment that I want to tell you about...I used to think buying premium dotcom domains was a waste of cash.I’d hear stories of people spending $500k on a dotcom domain and would silently laugh to myself.If only you spent that money on paid ads, viral videos, etc. That 500k might be 100k customers!You're just lighting the cash on fire for ego.But I was wrong... I recently started actually acquiring some dope domains.So, I ran an experiment.What if I took the same product and slapped on a new premium dotcom domain? A dot co for a dot com.And I started seeing the conversion rates jump 2-3xSame EXACT product, just a new domain, more customers.Pretty wild. But the dotcom adds trust and organic search.And some of these domains were under $10,000, not talking just $1M domains.Very short payback periods.So, yeah my realization is premium domains can be totally worth it especially in B2B.I'm starting to think about only starting companies that have premium domains...Brand matters more than ever.",

    "content": "27 mindsets to remember for 2024 if you’re an entrepreneur, solopreneur, mulitpreneur or creator:1. paying customers are the best VCs.2. a deal isn’t done it until the check cashes.3. move in silence or move loudly, nothing in between.4. you are not your company.5. cash flow > valuation.6. copycats are a nuisance, not killers.7. the gasoline for the internet is attention.8. you create your own narrative.9. scarcity sells. if something is sold out, you want it 10x more.10. taking a break doesn’t mean you’re lazy, burnout is real.11. luck favors the bold.12. venture capital is money with strings attached.13. date the product, marry the niche.14. get loud on the internet.15. community is your edge and your marketing bank account.16. don’t be cookie cutter, there is enough of that.17. distribution might be king, but community is the kingdom.18. social = owning billboards on the internet.19. a good business: selling sawdust.20. it’s still mindblowing to me that someone will pay you to press some buttons and push publish on the internet.21. there’s no middle class for solopreneurs or creators22. when everyone zigs, zag.23. \"To build something people love, you must do something more than what they expect.”24. Knowing when enough is enough is a super power. Never enough money, never enough followers, never enough whatever.25. every business has a few near death experiences, it’s okay.26. your business strategy: get going then get good.27. It’s easy to be average. You can’t commit to anything, don’t take risks, have anxiety to do anything new, and you waste a lot of time. Don’t be average.--Hope you enjoyed. The next step is to take these mindsets and turn them into actions.You can sign up to my weekly newsletter right here to make that happen. It takes 2 seconds. https://lnkd.in/e4TA7qqY",

    "content": "How to win on the internet:1. Marry the niche, date the product.2. Make a meme page. Understand the meme culture, own the community, use the insights for a product you'll sell.3. Educate over entertain. You can have more fun entertaining, you can make more money if you educate and if you do both you'll never need to find a job in your life again.4. Make friends with people in your industry. Earn their trust. Don’t ask for anything for a long time. Overwhelm with value. It’ll payback.5. Be different. Don’t just copy what other people do. Be the one that gets copied, not doing the copying. Way more cool.6. Listen to podcasts and take notes each time. It’s basically like you’re sitting in the room with the world’s greatest founders and entrepreneurs. Share notes with others, discuss.7. Throw small 10 person events in major cities. You can’t win on the internet by just being only on the internet.8. DM someone new everyday. Send them a Loom on why they should care.9. Have an email list. Don’t trust any social platform. Bank on your email list, not your follower count.10. Be good at introducing yourself. Your bio should reflect that. Everyone is interesting in one way or another.11. Have goals. Quantify them. Ask people how you're doing.12. Have a monthly investor update but just for trusted industry friends. Make it max 25 people. Ask for feedback on how you're doing. You can include your friends and family on it.13. Don't raise VC if you don't need to. Spoiler alert: you probably don't need to.14. Spend money on ads. It'll teach you how to write well in your niche because you don't want to waste any dollars. And you'll learn quickly what resonates with your niche.15. Focus on 1 social platform first, with one format of post. Until you have 100k followers, do not look at anything else.16. Be data-informed not data-driven. Don't do things because your analytics are telling you to do. You're a human being, you understand your community, act with a mix of art and science.17. Put buy buttons on the internet. Let people buy your products in many places. Don't be shy to sell.18. Get on the internet to post content ideas, get off the internet to get content ideas. “How vain it is to sit down to write when you have not stood up to live.”19. Set post notifications for the most interesting people in your space. Reply thoughtfully. You'll learn a lot.20. Big conferences are a waste of time and money. Better spend time/money elsewhere.21. Don't get jaded. They'll be bumps in the road, jerks on social, people copying your product but the internet is your oyster. Yours for the taking.22. Get smart at AI and hiring global talent. It'll save you time and keep you profitable.2024 is a fresh start. Go win big on the internet.--One idea for you to win on the internet in 2024 is use AI to build affiliate income.

Understand community sentiment2. Distill insights3. Create products to delightMy guess is companies like Zapier started to hear more and more complaints of monthly subs.We pay ~$40k/year for Figma. When I see the bill every month, it doesn't feel great.I wish it was pay-per-pixel, pay-per-project, one-time-purchase etc.If you're building a startup, it's easy to copy the existing business model and apply it to your niche etc.My advice:Don't.

I could see him making $50M/year ARR with creator software. That business would be worth $500M+→Wouldn't be surprised if YouTube acquired it in 2027.Creators are no longer just launching CPG.

    "content": "This is my 2024 annual planning guide for entrepreneurs, multipreneurs and creators.I put this post together to help you make the most of your year.It’s 8 questions to ask yourself, with a system to hold you accountable.Grab a coffee or drink and let’s dive in:1. What are 2 ridiculous goals for the year?Set 2 goals for 2024 so big it’ll make you laugh.But if you slow down, and put pen to paper, maybe it’s more realistic than you think.Turning your big ridiculous goals into just audacious goals by outlining the mini-steps to get there.Audacious goals are just ridiculous goals with steps to get there.2. What do “style points” look like for you?Winning your year isn’t just about hitting a dollar number, selling your company or going IPO.It’s about HOW you do it.Maybe it’s 100% creative freedom to build whatever you want.Maybe it’s working with your brother to build a family business.Maybe it’s working everyday in your underwear. I don’t know but writing it out helps.How you earn your money (style points) is just as if not more important than earning your money.3. What are the “uncool” opportunities that everyone is ignoring?The uncool opportunities are often the most interesting ones.In 2021, everyone was focused on crypto, very little on AI. Today, the opposite is true.In 2021, everyone was focused on VC-backed businesses, very little on cash-flowing businesses. Today, the opposite is true.A steady stream of uncool opportunities coming your way is critical.Be an opportunity miner in 2024. I call these opportunities \"silent giants\"4. What are 4 areas you need to get stronger at?This is the time of the 2024 planning session where you need to be extra honest with yourself.Think about your 2023 your experiences and challenges.Where do you feel you struggled? Where could you have performed better? Basically, what areas can you get stronger at?You know your goals. So write out what needs to succeed in order to hit your audacious goals.5. What business can I buy?So this might not be for everyone, but it's a worthwhile prompt for your new year.Three truths:1 - It’s easier to buy a business than to build a business.2 - It’s never been easier to buy a business with platforms like Acquire and QuietLight3 - You don't need $1M to buy a business. It's less than you thinkYou can get creative with seller financing, roll over equity (ie: giving equity in your new entity) etc.But first, finding an exceptional asset in 2024 that drives lots of income is the goal.Questions 6 - 8 are in the comments below (I saved the best for last).More of this type of stuff if you subscribe to my email gregisenberg.com (click subscribe)",

    "content": "My 2023 year in review building an 8 figure holding companyIncluding a net worth update, big wins, productivity unlocks, big losses etc-Big wins of 2023:1. Got married. Had a small wedding with only our immediate families for a small ceremony and dinner at a cute little french restaurant. Highly recommend a small wedding like that over a whole big wedding.2. We bought 50% of a business which became Boring Marketing dot com. Our first real acquisition. That business will do conservatively ~$2M-$3M of free cash flow next year. Reminds me that you only need a couple good ideas to have a wonderful career (and life).3. Nice cash flow for Late Checkout! We continued to grow several cash-flowing businesses at Late Checkout. If this isn’t product/market fit, I don’t know what is…4. Had someone offer Late Checkout $30M of PE capital. Didn’t take it. Felt good though.5. My newsletter became a habit! I wrote weekly in 2023 for the first time ever. And I hope you got value out of it. It helps me clarify my ideas. Highly recommend to you. (link in bio to join)6. Stayed true to myself. Didn’t get very distracted from competition or other founders. Maybe the biggest professional win of all?-Big losses of 20231. We listened to some bad advice for our innovation agency Late Checkout Agency. “Keep your team lean, a recession is coming, your Fortune 500 clients will cut innovation budgets”. We listened and that unnecessarily capped revenue.The reality is, these big companies need new products that drive revenue and community more than ever during a rough market.And we’ve been a pretty full utilization of our team the entire year.We lost out on $3M+ by just not listening to this advice. Damn.2. Hire one to hire 10. I wish I did more of this in 2023. These are the hires that multiply the business. Focused too much on hiring mid-level.3. I didn’t do enough 2-3 day IRL masterminds. Did a bunch off-sites with my team, but need to do more industry specific mastermind stuff.I’ve got some plans for 2024 here. I think quarterly is a good cadence for that dope of inspiration.4. Didn't buy a company in 2023. 2 deals fell through. Silver lining is now have a better process and thesis for M&A.Thank you for an incredible year. Here’s to an even bigger 2024.--I wrote a full post on my 2023 below (productivity unlocks etc). You'll need to subscribe to get access but it'll take 1 second. Enjoy! https://lnkd.in/eAVp27WA",

Play Madison Square Garden one day.And it’s happening for Andrew.Frank Sinatra’s “My Way” starts getting louder and louder.He runs up the stairs. Just too excited to walk.When he touches the steps of MSG, it feels like redemption.This is heaven on earth and you can’t argue otherwise.It oozes “I did it”.It oozes “I was nothing and now I’m something”Andrew Shultz is living his American dream, loud and clear.To me, I never had dreams of playing Madison Square Garden. You’re probably the same.But here's the raw truth: the internet is where everyone's wildest dreams come to life.Replace MSG with the internet and some weird niche of it that fascinates you.So, if you make it to the deep end of this post…1. Define your Madison Square Garden of the internet2.

    "content": "I'M FEELING SPICY TODAYI'll say the quiet parts out loud:1. Revenue per employee is going through the roof. What happens when tech companies need 10% or lower of the employees? Mass layoffs and less hiring.2. Your big tech company job is at risk. If we’ve learned anything from the 2022/2023 layoffs is that you probably should have a side hustle if you’re at bigtech3. Most VCs are soul-searching right now. What's the role of VC in 2024 when it’s never been cheaper to build software? Chasing LLM startups or hardware companies.4. Most brand social accounts are dead. Some creators will be created to be C-Suite at large brands. These deals will be 7-8 figures.5. All SaaS apps are about get copied. AI makes that easy. Prices of SaaS products will go down.6. There's a bunch of creators on tech X who literally just copy people's content. 7. Affiliate marketing is in its heyday. TikTok has become the largest affiliate platform in the world.8. Cash flow is way more interesting than valuation. Your stress levels are way lower when you run cash-flowing businesses versus on the VC train9. Lot of jerks on the internet, but building an audience is worth it. 10. It's still low status to build an audience. Only once you hit thousands of likes per post does it move up status. Keep going.11. There is no middle class creator. You are either scrambling to pick up a dollar or follower or flooded with dollars or followers12. Dividends are about to get way more common for founders. Raising money and giving a % of future profits makes so much sense13. If you want to get rich, don’t be a VC-backed founder. Odds are against you. Be a VC-backed founder if it's your dream.14. A bunch of creator-led products are going to burn their brand in an instant. Some will be pretty high profile.15. People are waking up to the fact that working for big tech is tough, working at a vc-backed startup and the safest/most desirable place to be is go independent16. Most ghostwritten posts have no soul. People aren't dumb, they recognize that LinkedIn post is written by an agency.I have a post coming out with all my 2024 predictions. The only way to get it is by subscribing to my newsletter www.gregisenberg.com (smash subscribe it'll take 2 secs)THANKS FOR READING MY SPICY TAKES",

They're pushing it big time.So, it's a ton of tailwind for you.I'd use ads, lives, or affiliate sellers to drive traffic.

    "content": "I saw this ad in Paris and it's a masterclass in creativity. Seriously, I can't get it out of my head.Being creative isn't easy. But it pays off.The internet belongs to those that let their imaginations run free.This new ad by Oatly is exactly this.Paris has this rule: ads on walls need to be more art than pitch.Oatly grabbed this rule and ran with it for their city debut.They splashed murals around town, masquerading as just another piece of street art.But wait for it... along comes an Oatly truck, lining up its load, and suddenly, the mural tells a whole new story.It's a clever, playful dance with the rules, showing Oatly's style while giving Parisians (and the internet) a wink.I'm not a fan of Oatly (more of a 2% regular milk guy), but it's a reminder that pushing the creative limits puts you at an unfair advantage.Oatly was able to spot what I call \"invisible opportunities\".They saw an opportunity where others saw a limitation.They could have easily promoted their products like everyone else. And they'd be like everyone else.Here's something for you to think about:In your space, there are invisible opportunities masquerading as constraints. The trick?Look where others aren't.The gold isn't in the problem; it's in the unique solutions only you can see.How do you push the limits on rebelling and fun?How do you GO BIG but in a punk rock way?People can feel that.

But it's always reliant on ad revenue and brand deals.Don't be in the newsletter business. Build a business powered by a newsletter.Instead of obsessing over open rates to please advertisers, channel your energy into building standout software.Create something that solves real problems, something people can't wait to use.Rather than just pumping up your email list numbers, shift your focus to growing a paid community.Bring people together who are as passionate about your project as you are.That's where you find real, sustainable growth – not just numbers, but engaged, paying members.And instead of pouring resources into buying subscribers, invest in building amazing products. Products that people love, talk about, and most importantly, buy.That's where the true value of your business lies.This approach transforms your newsletter from just a marketing tool into a empire building platform.You move from being an entrepreneur to being a multipreneur.It's where you share the journey of your products, connect with your community, and build a business that's not just about clicks and views, but about creating real, tangible value.",

    "content": "This is what I think happens over the next 5 years in software (how I think a new AI gold rush plays out):AI is getting so advanced that anyone with a good idea can create beautiful software.We're talking about SaaS tools, marketplaces, social apps so stunning that Steven Paul Jobs himself would stop and smile.There will be plenty of bootstrapped founders building software in their bedrooms or home offices.Imagine you find a niche, build some unique software. Things take off, and before you know it, you're raking in $1M run rate, maybe even $10M run rate.Sounds great, right?But here's the catch... the faster you rise, the quicker you might fall.Imagine this... a teenager in Illinois, just playing around, clones your app.Suddenly, checking your Stripe account feels like opening a letter from the IRS. Not so fun anymore.This era, my friends, is going to create a lot of wealth. But it's going to be a rollercoaster. Lots of these businesses won't last. The average software business will last months not years.Software is becoming like grains of sand on a beach – plentiful and, sadly, undervalued.It's a downward race on price. Today's victory can be tomorrow's loss.But here's the type of software that will survive 5+ years as cash-flowing machines:1. Platform discoverabilityBeing visible on places like GPT Store or Shopify is like having a neon sign for your product.The apps that have real estate here will outperform clones.2. Real communityThis is the heart of your product. You can clone features, but you can't clone a community.3. Organic reachGood old boring techniques like SEO. It's not dead, despite what people say. (this is a free course on how to 10x you organic via AI-assisted SEO here https://lnkd.in/edW6fYUT)So, to wrap up my thoughts...1. AI 10000x the amount of software out there. If you send a text message, you'll be able to create software.2. In the commoditized world of software, marketing isn't just king – it's the entire kingdom.That's the landscape for the next half-decade.Strap in, 2024 and beyond is going to be a wild ride.I've got a post I'm writing with more of my predictions.

    "content": "To entrepreneurs looking to start cash-flowing businesses:I remember a friend of mine worth $500M saying:“If you’ve got to sell something, sell it to rich people.”It got me thinking about luxury businesses.There are gold plated skateboards for $15,000 (SHUT Skateboards).There are toothbrushes for $4200 made of titanium (Reinast).There are smart sleep masks for $300 (Dreamlight Pro).Luxury products for just about everything.Observation: Sooner or later, every market ends up introducing a luxury segment..All ordinary products can have extraordinary luxury versions.Sometimes that means better quality, more scarce, more interesting story, more niche or all of the above.And the same is true for services.My innovation agency Late Checkout Agency was built on this premise. Max 12 clients per year. We work with companies to innovate and build new products to future proof their businesses.Point: average client size is $1M/year. And clients love us. Some tell us we're too cheap.And the more I understand luxury the more I realize there are layers to luxury.Michael Kors is accessible luxury. Gucci is luxury. Chanel is supreme luxury.I think we’re underestimating how many luxury markets can happen.We started seeing it with luxury software recently.Superhuman the $30/month email service is now worth $850M.Fun end of year prompt:What’s something that could use a luxury product or service?If you want more interesting startup stories, sign up to my newsletter https://lnkd.in/e4TA7qqY70,000+ people love it.",

    "content": "Without my new boss, former \"employee of the month\" at BestBuy, I'd be a real-life Grinch if I didn't make these changes...Getting started with internet businesses was roughIt felt like nothing would ever take offI'd have this \"insanely amazing\" idea. Get excited for the first few days. And that voice would creep up again, \"you failed before, you'll fail again.\"My professional bucket wasn't getting filled with how I was spending my timeI was peeved!Here's how I changed a few things and saw my luck 10x with it:1) Apprentice-first approachI said, \"maybe I need to learn from someone that's way ahead\"I love being on a team because I receive quick feedbackWhat would my life be like if I had a career that was similar?2) Don't listen to what they sayI used to say \"just talk to people. network.\"Bad advice. Most people don't share the ugly truth about their day-to-day.In my previous roles, I'd stalk my executives' calendars, and ask:\"Would I enjoy this schedule?\"3) Think in podsI expected to work on strategic projects, and zoom back in the day-to-day on a regular basis at every company I was hired at. I was naive.So I used side projects, and building something on the side to fill that void.But doing it alone bored me. I'd rather have someone a Slack message away than browse YouTube and subreddits to figure out what to do.And while, the method may work, it takes timeThat's my next point4) Decades, not weeks4 years is not a long time. So I asked myself, \"can I see myself doing this for at least 4 NFL Seasons? No? Skip.\"5) Using mental reframesWhen I was young, my parents always said, \"If you put half the effort in math as you did with tennis, we wouldn't be having this conversation.\"I like tennis and teamwork; early practice? cool. match tomorrow? nice.How could I structure my professional life to incorporate the things that I love in my hobbies?After taking these 5 prompts seriously and since joining Late Checkout, my professional bucket really, really changedWatching Greg Isenberg, Theo Tabah, and Jordan Mix jam on ideas, spar on what to do next, and ship something out is like a 8-week MBA bootcamp compressed into a 30 minute meetingI'll occasionally share on our inner workings and business, marketing, and design trends we're seeingFeels like a time machine looking into the futureOne shift we're witnessing is how much design plays a role in bringing you strangers that actually want to become your customersLet's face it—building something people want is really hardOffering our services via Dispatch to busy founders and team leads feels like giving them a cheat code to creatively grow their businessIn the spirit of posting about the inner workings I promised you earlier, I wanted to share the new websiteEven though it's still a work in progress (98% finished), it would mean the world to me if you could share it with someone who could benefit from our services: https://meetdispatch.com/",

    "content": "I got a pretty crazy call from a founder friend...“I got an offer for $100M to buy my company and I’m taking it.”Let’s grab a drink. I need to hear the story.I’ll give you the details so you’re on the inside but keeping the company name anonymous.So, he raised ~$25M of venture, 2 co-founders, business is 9 years old. Owns 6% of the business after all the VC dilution.Had an M&A offer at 20x ARR in 2021 → Didn’t take it.Had an M&A offer at 15X ARR in early 2022 → Didn’t take it.Got an acquisition offer at 5x ARR for $100M → Ended up taking it.“I turned 30 and was just really burnt out. And truth is, I’ve been building this for 9 years and I didn’t think I could raise my next round at the valuation I wanted ”I mean the guy did start with the best head of hair of out my friend group and now looks as bald as Mr. Clean.After I gave him a quick cheers congratulating on the wire hitting, he got real with me:“I’ll make $6M pre-taxes which is obviously incredible to make that much. But I wonder would of happened if I never raised that funding in 2020”.See, my buddy ran it as a profitable business until 2020 and then swung for the fences. He was making $1.5M/year in profit at the time of the first round.But it gets you thinking….If you’re making $1.5M/year of free cash-flow, and you grow a conservative 30% year over year… Your outcome is probably better than if your raised venture capital. And it’s definitely less stressful.Less stakeholders, less pressure, more dividends. And my favorite part is without that pressure and with those dividends, you get to live a pretty dope lifestyle.From 2017-2019, I was the CEO of a venture-backed startup.I was earning $75k USD/year living in SF. Could barely afford brunch on that ;).I almost had an opportunity to do a secondary in our Series A, but it all fell through.Being reliant on VC to sign terms sheets isn’t that fun. I like relying more on myself.And my friend who sold his company for $100M… I asked him if he’s going to work at the acquirer:“No, I’m going to go buy some distressed VC-backed assets like someone did to me and not raise a penny of VC and dividend and compound like there is no tomorrow”.Probably a pretty smart idea…--For more unfiltered startup stories like this, sign up to my newsletter. https://lnkd.in/e4TA7qqY (for a more successful 2024)",

    "content": "When I first started building internet businesses, nothing worked.I was miserable.I’d have this “brilliant” startup idea. Pour all my energy into it. And it just didn’t hit.I changed a few things and my luck 10x-ed with it.Honestly, I'd be working BestBuy right now without these tweaks...1) Audience-first approachBefore any product, I build an audience.If I can’t build the audience, I don’t build the product.The audience doesn't just validate the idea, they shape it2) A sticky nameLots of people say names don’t matter.“Just build something people love.”Not true. A quality name is an idea virus.It’s gum on your shoe or that song you can't get out of your head.How do you build a category of one?3) Think in funnelsI guess I just expected people to come back to my products. I was naive.But you have to remind them. And not be shy to ask for their emails or SMS.In return, give them something they really want.That’s my next point.4) 90% of your products should be free, 10% paidGive away stuff to make an impression.Digital assets, free communities, challenges to stimulate your community etc.Your Shopify shouldn’t be only paid products.Free products that build mega trust with hearts and minds.And If you win the heart, the cart follows.5) Using spy softwareEtsyHunt, Subredditstats, Google Trends are your best friends.The data is out there.The tools are out there that give you a microscope into what’s happening with a community.And what sort of startup ideas are working (and not working).All you have to do is listen, take notes and take action.Bonus 6) What's noise or what's signalConferences, being in TechCrunch and being on Forbes Lists are examples of things that massively overvalued.Making it a habit to ask yourself is what you're doing noise or signal, is probably one of the greatest productivity unlocks for entrepreneurs.I wish I knew this stuff earlier. My luck changed as I took these 6 prompts more seriously.I'm sharing because maybe this might be helpful to you on your journey.Because let's be real... building your own business empire ain't as easy as people make it seem.Entrepreneurship is ruthlessly hard.We can use all the luck we can get.Here's a guide to the 6 free tools I use to gain my unfair advantage.
