    "content": "Meet my ex-CEO, Ayman Al-Abdullah.He joined AppSumo in 2016, and took the company from $3M to $84 million per year in revenue in only 6 years.Now, as a CEO coach, Ayman helps 7-figure CEOs get to 9-figure by working less.Here’s his story:==Before joining AppSumo, Ayman had started a few businesses–but struggled to get them off the ground.So he took an internship at an accounting firm.But immediately... he knew it wasn't for him.Luckily, Ayman Al-Abdullah parlayed that experience into a position at Microsoft, where he worked for 3-4 years.He was part of a rotational program and loved that he got to learn new skills.But eventually, the pull of entrepreneurship was too strong to ignore…“If you want to be an entrepreneur,” Ayman said.“The best way to learn is to work for an entrepreneur you respect and admire. It’s better than any MBA or anything you can learn on your own.”Before leaving Microsoft, Ayman recorded two pitch videos.First, to be Sam Altman’s chief of staff (he was CEO of YC at the time), and second, to me.Ayman's pitch video: https://t.co/ONiIDAtVZ3We started Ayman on a 2-week trial. He had to close 2 deals in 2 weeks.(We still have people do trials to this day)Even though he was still working at Microsoft full–time, he crushed the trial and we hired him.Ayman was living in Seattle at the time, and moved to Austin with just the stuff in his backpack (this was in 2015, before moving to Austin was the cool thing to do).“In the first year, our only goal was survival,” Ayman recalled.“Every profit we made at AppSumo went straight to funding SumoMe. It was just me running the show, and hiring help seemed impossible.”So Ayman got creative:He paid an intern $15/hour to take repetitive work off his plate—so he could focus on sales.That decision alone doubled the business.Don’t just work hard. Work smart.Before Ayman, we were stuck around ~$5M in revenue. Under Ayman’s leadership, AppSumo’s revenue skyrocketed from $5M to $70M in six years.But Ayman’s proudest accomplishment is the team:“Most tech companies have an 18-month turnover. At AppSumo, we have a leadership team that’s been in place for over 6 years,” Ayman said with a grin.And in 2021, we were rated the #1 place to work in Austin for tech.Now Ayman is a CEO coach helping 7-figure CEOs get to 9-figures.5 pieces of Ayman's advice for aspiring CEOs:1- Get clear about what you wantStarting a business (0-1) and scaling a business (1-n) are completely different ball games.Most founders are better off selling their company or hiring an operator.If you’re determined to keep your company, Ayman advises first defining what success means to you:• Do you want 100s of employees?• Do you want more of a lifestyle business?• Are you chasing a big IPO?==Looks like I reached the word limit... 😅Read the full article (or listen to our full conversation) here:https://lnkd.in/emvvq-bT",

    "content": "I was employee #30 at Facebook. Then I got fired.For a long time, I was bitter that they let me go.But the lessons I learned from Mark and Facebook helped me build a $100 million/year company.10 lessons I learned from working directly under Mark Zuckerberg:==1) Focus on ONE goal“Mark, we’re not profitable. Let’s try selling tickets inside Facebook events,” I pleaded.He said no.Then he took a dry-erase marker and wrote on the board: GROWTH.Mark’s goal was 1 billion users.Every idea we’d bring, he’d ask, “Does this help growth or not?”If it wasn’t driving toward that goal, we didn’t do it.You don’t grow fast by doing many things, but by doing ONE thing extremely well.==2) Move fastAt Facebook, it was normal to work 12+ hours a day.Mark constantly pushed us to have a sense of urgency. One of his internal mantras was “Move fast and break things”.“Unless you are breaking stuff, you are not moving fast enough.” he’d say.We shipped several updates to the site every day.In comparison, companies like Microsoft would take months to write out product details, discuss them in a lot of meetings, and finally build them.As a startup, your biggest advantage against giant companies is speed.==3) Only hire A PLUS playersMark would only hire people he would be happy to work for.Even our customer support team was filled with Harvard PhD’s.The people from Facebook have gone on to help found Asana, Quora, AppSumo 😉, OpenAI, and more.When you’re in a startup, the first ten people you hire are the most critical.Each makes up 10% of the company.If three are not great, that’s 30% of your company!A startup depends on great people much more than a big company.==4) Treat your employees wellMark recognized that having a work environment you want to work in would appeal to potential employees...And make the existing ones proud to be there (and stay later at night).Facebook did a lot of things that are the norm now:1. A fancy office in one of the most expensive neighborhoods of Silicon Valley2. Hyper competitive salaries3. $1000 office chairs for everyone4. Comped PowerBook and BlackBerry5. Delicious breakfast, lunch, and dinner catered6. Fridge stocked with any drink you can imagine7. All expenses paid company trips to Las Vegas8. Free happy hours every Friday9. Free laundry/dry cleaning service10. Subsidized housing. $600/month if you lived within 1 mile of the office.11. Summer housing/Winter Cabin that anyone could use==5) Scratch your own itchMany people start businesses in a category they don’t know much about or have an interest in because they’re told it’s “hot” or “trending”.At the start, Mark never intended to build a company. He was just trying to help connect people at college.Build selfishly, share selflessly.==Whoops... looks like I hit the character limit.Read the rest here: 👇👇https://lnkd.in/e_6F_9hs",

    "content": "This is Peter Maldonado.In 2009, he went bankrupt and lost it all.15 years later, his company is making $500M/year selling meat sticks (yes, you read that correctly).My top 9 takeaways from his story:1- Focus on ONE thingBefore declaring bankruptcy, Peter was involved in many things.He bought and flipped houses. He sold real estate. He also started a food company called Frozen Fitness. “Stretched thin” is an understatement.After he lost it all, he spoke with a mentor who told him the best way to create real wealth was to pick ONE thing and focus on being the best at it.After interviewing many billionaires, I’ve found that to be true:Larry Janesky → BasementsJohn Paul DeJoria → HaircareMichael Hudner → Shipping ContainersDiversification is for wealth preservation and protection, not wealth creation.2- Make what you wish existedIn 2011, Peter met his future business partner Rashid Ali.Peter told him about his favorite snack as a kid (meat sticks), and his desire to make a healthier version that was high in protein, low in calories, and tasted just as good.Rashid, who was working as a business operations consultant at the time, loved the idea. Just a few weeks later, they started Chomps as a side hustle.When in doubt, solve your own problems. If you are willing to pay for a solution, it’s likely others are too.3- Reverse engineer greatnessWhile Peter and Rashid both had a background in business, they faced one big problem:They didn’t know anything about the meat industry.So what did they do?They went to the store and bought all the meat sticks they could find. Then they looked at the USDA label, found the co-packer, and reached out to them (GENIUS!!)They did the same thing when they were designing their branding. They dissected what their competitors were doing, took the best, put it together, and refined from there.4- It doesn’t need to be perfectWhen I asked Peter what advice he’d give to beginning entrepreneurs, he said, “You don’t have to have things perfect before you bring them to market. Get it out as fast as possible, get feedback, and iterate from there.”When he started his first food company Frozen Fitness, he spent so much time on the website that he didn’t sell anything through it before shutting the company down.Think NOW, not HOW!!5- Don’t recklessly go “all in”In Chomps’ first year, they made $35,000 in sales. The following year, they made $100k+.But it was STILL just a side hustle.It wasn’t until they made $400k and consistently brought in profits that they went full-time.This is something I’ve written about before…It’s sexy to say you “burned the boats” and went all in.But it’s much simpler (and realistic) to build a side hustle alongside your day job, hit your freedom number, and then jump ship if you want.Read the rest of my top 9 takeaways from Chomps here: https://lnkd.in/eTXg8yMJ",

    "content": "My #1 regret in life:I wish I had taken myself and dating more seriously in my 20s.5 pieces of Brutally Honest relationship advice that I’d give to my younger self (so you can avoid my mistakes):1/ Improve yourselfYou have to love yourself before you can expect someone else to.And if you don’t, it’s a BIG ask to imagine a person will love and fix you.The best way I’ve found is to focus on the things under your control:You can control:• Your effort• How you dress• Who you hang out withThey won't guarantee someone will show up on your doorstep like Uber Eats...But they guarantee you’ll like yourself - and I promise over time someone else will like you too.2/ Be binary about what you’re looking forWhen you ask people what they want in a partner, they all say the same things.“Funny. Attractive. Sweet.”Cool. But a lot of people are those things.Here’s what works better...Have binary filters:• Kids or No Kids?• Jewish or Not Jewish• They want to live in BarcelonaSuper black and white.Having more clear filters makes saying no much easier.3/ Be where the fish areInitially, I thought dating a Jewish person was a big requirement for me.So I went to Israel. LA. New York.But after dating a few Jewish women, it turned out that being Jewish wasn’t a big deal to me.The lesson is the same when you’re marketing for your business.Meet your customers where they are.My friend went to Colombia to find his wife. I met my wife in Barcelona.Where does your ideal partner live? Where are you?4/ The Dinner TestA while back, my brother asked me a question that I still remember to this day.He asked, “If you couldn’t have sex with that person, would you still be with them?”And for all of my past dates, the answer was “No”.You have to like your partner mentally.Why? Because you'll have at least 1,000 dinners with them.It’s important to genuinely enjoy being with your partner, you’ll be sharing many meals together.5/ Don’t settleA while back, I got engaged to a girl because everything was moving in that direction. I thought that was what I was supposed to do.But then my business partner Chad asked, “Are you getting what you’re getting or are you getting what you want?”As adults, we often let society's norms and expectations drown out our intuition.Go to college. Get good grades. Get a ‘safe’ job. Work 40 hours a week in a boring cubicle. Work until you’re 65+. And save your best adventures until retirement.But deep down inside...We know when we’re settling.Now, I constantly ask myself, “How did I trick this woman into being my wife?”I feel so lucky to be with Mafe.~~I’ve failed MANY times over the years.

    "content": "I hated Sam Parr.He was annoying when I first met him, well sometimes he can still be annoying today 😆BUT he’s someone I’ve become close friends with and have been regularly admiring him.Why? Present as a father, prioritizes his marriage and seems to be making a lot of money doing things he loves. No compromises.So on a recent car drive, I asked him how he seems so aligned. Living a life that appears fulfilling.He mentioned he has 3 things he considers in his working life:1- Is it fun?He loves meeting people - created JoinHampton. He had a problem finding accountants / lawyers - created samslist. Wanted to interview interesting people - created MyFirstMillion. He refuses to create or work on business without personal interest.2- Can I make at least 7-figures from it?With all of his projects he thinks before he starts can he make at least 7-figures from it personally. Be mindful of your market size. If you’re going to work hard either way at least be aware of how big the opportunity is.3- Do I have unique expertise or an advantage in doing it?With his new project Samslist he has a large audience of customers / partners that he can easily promote this service. He sold his ranch when realizing he was better at tech. And for his new business launches, they are all related to his zone of influence.I’d also add a few more things I’ve noticed from Sam:1- Hire CEOs. With every business Sam finds a CEO to put in place once he gets it going. This frees up his time and he can spend his cycles advising the CEO rather than being one.2- His partner Sara Parr. She’s life-upgraded him. This has been such a game-changer for me to find a partner who teaches and supports me on a regular basis.3- No fucks given. I love when Sam calls out VCs harassing people or he chooses to showcase his mother-in-law's pillow company. He’s not optimizing for an algorithm. I often find myself thinking - what will people think or this won’t help me get followers but seeing Sam inspires me to just be me.4- Sam still makes the calls. When he was starting Hamptons or Samslist - Sam is the one who starts it and does intensive customer calls to understand the business. I love the intensity and work that he’s willing to put in to get a business started.Thanks for the inspiration Sam Parr 🙇‍♂️",

    "content": "This past year, I’ve been learning how to be a husband/father, speak Spanish, and improve my leadership.Here’s my process for learning:1) Have a good reason to learnI learned Hebrew to speak with my dad in heaven.I’m learning Spanish because my wife and her family speak it.Where do you want to be in 5 years?Write out your goal and put it on your mirror or phone so you see it regularly.When things get tough, remind yourself of your Why.2) Hire coachesWe think our problems are unique. But millions of people have faced similar problems. You don’t have to reinvent the wheel.At @AppSumo, we spend $1M+/yr on coaches and advisors for our team.Who can you find that’s already gone to the promised land?And if you can’t afford to hire a coach… read more biographies.There are million-dollar lessons hidden in $30 books.Biographies give you a unique peek into the lives of great people.Why not learn from those who have come before you?3) Put it on your calendarEvery week in my calendar, I schedule 1 hour to study leadership.I go to YouTube, HBR.org, and read books.Most of the information you need is out there. It’s about making time to study and integrate it into your life.4) Be patient with the resultsI know that isn’t what you want to hear. We all want to learn a language, be an expert, or top CEO in a week.But realize that this is a journey that’s going to take you 10 years (or even longer).In school, we spend 15 years learning English.So it's okay if you’re not fluent in another language in 3 months.It’s not just about learning a skill and never using it.It’s about integrating that skill into your daily life.And that takes time and patience.5) Practicing vs. PlayingI’ve been playing squash for a while, and I watch a lot of videos to study the gameplay.But there’s a VERY big difference between playing to have fun - and practicing deliberately to get better.For squash, that would mean practicing backhands over and over and over.Don’t just wing it. Practice.6) Find an accountability buddyEvery Sunday, I email my friend Adam Gilbert with my priorities.Adam will hold me accountable for things that I didn’t do or could have been improved (and vice versa). I’ve done this for the past 15 years.“If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.”7) Follow the Law of 100Most people fail to learn new skills because they quit too soon.• Put out 100 videos.• Record 100 podcasts.• Reach out to 100 potential customers. Get your reps in and you WILL see results.Our team created a free tool to help you stay consistent: lawof100.com How to learn anything faster:1. Have a good reason to learn2. Hire coaches3. Put it on your calendar4. Be patient with the results5. Practicing vs. Playing6. Find an accountability buddy7.

    "content": "My newest startup did $60,093+ in 40 days.It’s our 4th product in the last 3 years on track to generate $1M in revenue in ~12 months.Here's our 5-step process to launch winning products:Last week, I sat down with David Kelly, the General Manager for AppSumo Originals to share how we ideate, build, test, and launch products.Context: The goal of AppSumo Originals products (TidyCal, KingSumo, SendFox) is to introduce people into the AppSumo ecosystem.1) Use Prioritization ChecklistsMany founders and leaders are familiar with the RICE prioritization framework (Reach, Impact, Confidence, and Effort).At AppSumo Originals, we use a 4-step prioritization checklist:1) Hyped AF - Are we hyped AF about this? “I’m always surprised and amazed by how many entrepreneurs build things they don’t really want,” David said. “But that’s a recipe for an unwanted and unused product.” Scratch your own itch!2) New Buyers - does this serve the customers we want to attract? “We aren’t afraid to look at competitors,” David said candidly. “Competition means there is market availability and that we can approach it a bit differently.”3) Ease of Creation - is this a relatively easy product to create? “AppSumo customers have begged for a Canva alternative,” David said. “But the complexity is way outside of our wheelhouse. We don’t want to spend years building in the dark.”4) Word of Mouth - All three of our previous winners had virality baked into the product,” David said. “When people share their TidyCal link, send emails using SendFox, or share a document through BreezeDoc - it introduces the product to new potential customers.” GENIUS!!2) Velocity to The DollarThe reason we’ve limited the number of failed startups at AppSumo is simple:We validate the idea BEFORE we fully build it out.Before building BreezeDoc, we asked people if they’d pre-buy a DocuSign alternative.Once we see enough interest in the idea, THEN we start to build it out.We started working on BreezeDoc at the end of January.“We keep the team small on purpose to start,” David said. “Just me, a designer, and a developer at first. When the team is too large, we get too many opinions, which leads to inaction.”3) Work WITH CustomersOur 30-day MVP process has 3 phases:Phase 1: First Beta VersionThe first thing we do is collect a lot of information on our customers. We TALK to them as much as possible (obviously using a TidyCal link 😉)Phase 2: Customer FeedbackFor BreezeDoc, we did about 6 weeks of beta testing and iterating. This is longer than usual, but we wanted to make sure to get REALLY great feedback.Phase 3: Marketing ExperimentsThe goal for the first 30 days was to get 100 new customers.With that, we worked backward to put together a spreadsheet of marketing activities we could do.By the end of the month, we had 189 new buyers.

    "content": "I’ve had a lot of amazing marketing experiences in my career:• Helped Facebook scale to 50M users• Grew Mint from 0 to 1M users in 6 months• Currently run AppSumo doing 9-figures in revenue• 100,000 copies of Million Dollar WeekendHere’s how I create a marketing plan:==1) Identify the problem you’re solvingThe #1 question to answer is “What problem am I solving?”I don’t do any marketing until I know my product is desired!No amount of marketing will solve a product problem==A few years ago, we built a site called MeetFam. It was an automatic email tool for e-commerce sites. We tried every marketing strategy you could think of:• Direct outreach • Paid ads• Blog posts• Social mediaBut guess what? No one wanted it. I even begged!So how do you know if you’re solving a problem people are excited about?==The Dollar Test:First, are they EXCITED to give you money?If you have to convince them, they’re not.==2) Identify your ideal customerAt AppSumo, we have customer avatars of who we’re serving.The more specific you are, the better.If you have 0 idea who your customer is. Survey them. Pro tip: Ask your existing customers where they hang out!==The best marketers fall in love with their customers.You can’t create an effective marketing strategy without first knowing: 1. Who your customers are2. Where they hang out==3) Pick ONE hyper-focused goal“Mark, we’re not profitable. Let’s try selling tickets inside Facebook events,” I pleaded.He said no.Then he took a dry-erase marker and wrote on the board: GROWTH.You don’t grow fast by doing many things, but by doing ONE thing extremely well.==Most people set vague goals.A goal needs to have a number and a time frame:• 150,000 email subscribers in 12 monthsThen you can break your goal into a timeline of smaller targets.==4) Create your marketing experiment listMarketing is about TESTING things to see what to double down on.Most people stick with losers too long and don’t stick with winners long enough.Create a list of channels and expected sales.==5) Double down on what worksOnce you start marketing, really look at what’s working.Maybe offline events are working – so how do you do 10 of them a day?I constantly remind my team to “Double down, double down, double down!!”==Even more importantly, stop doing stuff that’s not working.Our goal this year is 150k active subscribers. Not Instagram. Not TikTok. Not Threads.It’s Twitter / YouTube → EmailDo less, but better.==How to create your million-dollar marketing plan:1/ Identify the problem you’re solving2/ Identity the customer you’re serving3/ Pick ONE hyper-focused goal4/ Create your marketing experiment list5/ Double down on what worksFollow Noah Kagan for more content like this!",

    "content": "I asked my audience for their BEST piece of parenting advice...Thank you ALL soooooo much, it was overwhelming, and felt very loved with great advice. We picked some of our favorite 10 in no particular order.. for all the parents (or parents-to-be) out there:==1- Deal with your own shitWe all have emotional baggage from past experiences.The best thing you can do is make sure you’re good on the inside - so you don’t transfer it on your child.Ryan Holiday==2- Support your womanDon’t make it 50/50. She suffered more to do it, so treat her like a fucking queen.Sam Parr==3- Avoid temptation to get out of the house.For the first month, at least, spend time with your baby & wife and block out the world.Don't travel, don't get on your phone, don't work.This early commitment will help your wife feel safe as her body heals, and builds the family with a stronger foundation.@bandholz==4- Presence > PresentsThe best gift you can give your child is your time - be present, listen, and lead by example.@SleepMoneyMaker==5- Never stop dating your wifeHave a date with your wife at least once a week as soon as you both feel ready and keep that going. Your relationship with her is the foundation on which your ability to be good parents is built.@KonstantinKisin==6- Create ‘family guidelines’ to live by• Gilberts don’t break promises• Kagans don’t quitWhen times are tough, your child can look to these guidelines for guidance.@MyBodyTutor==7- It's your baby.If you don't want someone holding them, then politely tell them to fuck off. In fact, it's OK to not have anyone over for as long as you want.Be patient and respectful while having boundaries.@bandholz==8- Don’t do too much for themThey are going to make messes, fall, fail, try to do things they are not capable of doing, etc.Don’t step and do for them. Coach them. Teach them. Help them, but don’t do it for them.The more your kid realizes they can figure things out on their own, the more confident they will become.@scottreyes==9- You are going to screw upYou’ll lose your shit and yell at them. You’ll break a promise you made. You’ll set a bad example.Don’t beat yourself up over it, but more importantly, apologize.Show your kids what it looks like to be accountable for your actions.@scottreyes==10- Enjoy the journeyWhen they cry, your eyes will get wet. When they laugh, you'll smile. The days will be hard, and long, and exhausting.But deeper and more meaningful (If you let them be.)In a blink, your baby will be 1, then 3, then going to kindergarten. Most people never get told that the time between 0 - 5 years old is a peak life experience.But now you have been. Don't waste it.@themichaelcrist==There were SO many golden nuggets - thanks to everyone who shared their advice!! 🙏 🙏",

I have three offices: one I rent to AppSumo, the other two to various parties.I also invest in several index funds (SPLG, SPDW, SPSM, SPEM) and have some Crypto.EXPENSES BREAKDOWN:You can probably guess, the number one expense is Mr. Government (a lady would never be so rude).They take 37% (around $1.2m).The second expense is my content team. That's about $500,000.Next, I live in a $2.5m house.The house by itself without water, internet, and cleaning expenses is $120k a year.Property taxes alone are $40,000+ a year.Note: I’m 10x happier now in a $2.5m home than when I was in a $500k home.I didn’t realize how much your home base impacts your happiness.I spend around $20-25k/mo on lifestyle stuff (food, clothes, etc.).Then I have insurance, mortgage, wealth advisor (5-figures), bookkeeper (5-figures), food delivery ($500/mo).Follow Noah Kagan for more content like this!5 takeaways from my income breakdown (in the comments): 👇👇",

    "content": "I’ve spent the last 7 years interviewing the world’s greatest entrepreneurs.5 key learnings (from 10,000 hours of my podcast):1/ Don’t Be The Best, Be The OnlyIn 1993, Kevin Kelly and his co-founders started Wired Magazine. At the time, they faced zero competition. They were the only magazine talking to tech founders - and it was a strong selling point when they pitched advertisers.Many people are familiar with your Zone of Genius - the intersection between what you love, what you’re good at, and what you get well paid for.But Kevin told me there’s actually a fourth level. Which is, “Can anybody else do that?”So how do you find what only you can uniquely do?You’re not going to find it by thinking about it. You have to go out in the world and try stuff. Start projects. Experiment. Fail. Reflect. Fail again. And then, and only then, will the fourth level reveal itself.2/ Don’t Burn The Boats“I thought I was dying, I was hallucinating, I was screaming at the top of my lungs. My wife didn't know what to do.”In 2018, Justin Welsh was making $500k/year as the VP of Sales at PatientPop. (Impressive!!)But it wasn’t all peaches and cream. As the company scaled, Justin became overwhelmed with more teammates, more revenue, and more problems. And soon enough - it all boiled over.The morning after a company Christmas party, he suffered a major panic attack.That’s when he realized he needed to take back control over his life. He quit drinking alcohol. He fixed his diet. And he started consulting to eventually quit his job.Now, Justin makes $5M/year as a solopreneur selling information products.“Find an hour each day to grow a side project. Replace 60% of your current income while trending in the right direction. Then make your move,” Justin said. “It’s almost always a better decision.”The two paths he recommends:1. Identify what you’re already getting paid for. Build a portfolio of services that mirror the same outcomes. Go out and find companies who need your services.2. Pick something you’re obsessed with. Go find someone who’s done it successfully. Study the living hell out of them. Do it your way. Then help people who want to do the same thing.3/ Everyone Is Winging ItPaul Orfalea is the legendary founder of Kinko’s. If you haven’t heard of Kinko’s, it was a leading retail chain for copying machines in the late 90s.Paul ran the company for 30 years, and FedEx later acquired it for $2.4 billion dollars in 2004!A piece of advice that Paul’s mother gave to him has stuck with me.“In your 20s, try everything. In your 30s, figure out what you do best. In your 40s, make money from what you do best, and try not to do too much in your 50s.”Too many people beat themselves up because they don’t have everything 100% figured out. But it takes YEARS - even decades - to figure out what you do best.Continued in the comments 👇👇",

    "content": "I’m the CEO of a $100 million business.But the first 10 years of my career:• Rejected by Google (2x)• Fired by FB after 9 months• Built 20+ startups that didn’t work out (ouch!)Here are 18 pieces of brutally honest career advice (I wish I knew earlier):1/ It’s okay to feel lost. When you’re in your 20s, you’re not supposed to know exactly what you want to do with your career. Instead of trying to predict your career path, focus on taking daily action.2/ Take more swings. Early on, you can afford to take more risks because you have fewer obligations. Do free work to get your foot in the door. Fly across the country to meet with an investor. Start the crazy business idea with your roommate. You only need ONE to win.3/ Be the hub. When I graduated, I hosted meetups and conferences…even when I didn’t know anyone. The people I helped like Ramit Sethi, Tim Ferriss, and Ryan Holiday ended up helping me 15 years down the line. Ask the smartest people you know, “Who is ONE person I should meet?’4/ Document your learning online. Creating content is a career cheat code. I’ve been writing on my personal blog since 2000 (!!) Worst case? You learn how to write and promote your work. Best case? You attract life-changing opportunities.5/ Learn copywriting. Copywriting is not about hitting a word count or writing a five-paragraph essay. It’s about capturing attention and persuading action. You will never be disappointed by improving your communication skills.6/ Master the art of the cold email. I’ve been sending cold emails since I was a freshman. The best cold emails: Get to the point. Instantly grab attention. Answer “What’s in it for me?” If you shoot 100 shots, you’re bound to land one hit.7/ Mentors are overrated. The best way to find a mentor? Become someone worth mentoring. Start things. Encounter a problem. Ask for SPECIFIC feedback, not advice. Report back on how you did. Repeat. You’ll realize you never needed a “mentor” in the first place.8/ Build independent income streams. Getting fired at Facebook taught me that EVERYONE is replaceable. Start more side hustles. You’ll learn more, earn independent income, and maybe even replace your income to go full-time.9/ Give way less f*cks about other people. No amount of money, followers, or acknowledgment will quench your thirst for fulfillment. The people you’re trying to impress aren’t even thinking about you in the first place. Don't prove others wrong. Prove yourself right.10/ Have more patience. In my 20s, I was impatient to get rich and famous. I beat myself up a ton. That’s a miserable way to live. You don’t have to be so hard on yourself. If you’re doing the reps, the results WILL pay off. Be impatient with actions and patient with results.Continued in the comments 👇👇",

    "content": "Few like to say it out loud - but your health & face are one of the most important things in life.Makes business and life a whole lot easier :)Here’s my simple skincare routine (that anyone can copy):I get asked all the time about my skincare routine. I’m 42. Started it at 25.Most of it - I credit my genetics (thanks Mom and Dad!!)So that’s tip #1: Choose better parents.Just kidding 😂1) Use SunblockWhen I was 25, I met with a guy named Surya Yolamanchi.He was on a TV show called The Apprentice and worked at Neutrogena.He said, “Noah, if you can take away one thing from me, it’s start doing skincare early.”And the easiest way to start is by using sunblock.I use a Neutrogena roll-on - and it’s literally the easiest thing to do.If you only try one thing, use sunblock. It’s a game-changer.2) Take CollagenEvery morning, I take two collagen pills.Studies have shown that taking collagen pills every day for three months makes skin more hydrated, elastic, smooth, and dense.One of my hacks is I leave them out the night before and put them on my counter - so I remember to take them.3) Scrub and CleanseI use Acure brightening facial scrub. It’s made out of kale. Tasty.After I scrub, I use a Coconut cleanser from Eminence Organic skincare - it smells good. You’ll want to eat it - but you can’t 😂I do this once or twice a week in the shower.4) Use A Night LotionAt night, I’ll rotate between three things:I’ll either use a vitamin C serum, Cerave PM lotion, or Hada Labo Tokyo skin plumping gel cream.Again, I know this may seem like a lot. So start simple. Just start with sunblock - and then build up to these things. Over time, it will slowly compound.5) Try A Facial TonerThose close to me know that I HATE showering. So at night, if my face is dirty - I’ll use Thayers facial toner with one of my wife’s face pads.It’s pretty crazy to see how dirty your face gets.6) Schedule a quarterly facialIn my calendar, I have a quarterly facial. They’re about $100-$150 in the US and 60 euros in Spain.It’s cool. They give you a massage, pull out your blackheads, and it’s relaxing. It’s like a carwash for your face.7) Drink more waterAnother thing I emphasize is drinking a lot of water.I leave a bottle out on my table at night - so when I wake up I see it and drink it.It’s little habits like these that truly do add up over time.Focus on consistencyI’ve been doing a lot of this stuff consistently for the past 10+ years, and now, I almost don’t think about it.But at the start, it can be overwhelming. If you miss a day, don’t beat yourself up. Just focus on doing it the next day.Start small. Make things easy for yourself. And have fun with it!Rooting for you,Noah 🌮Ps.

    "content": "It's been 30 days since our new SaaS product (BreezeDoc) went live.The results:4,500+ total signups88% paid signup CVR (!!!)$40,000+ topline revenueThis isn't a one-hit wonder either. BreezeDoc is our 5th product in the last 3 years to generate >$20,000 and >1,000 signups within 30 days of launch.It's not magic how we got here. We have a process that many people can copy...Here's what we did:1) It took us 6 weeks to build and launch the product. I think people typically overcomplicate reqs/spec documents. I focus on simplicity, and I put together 16 bulleted features in a Google Doc that I think we needed to make our v1 good enough. I keep the 80/20 Rule in mind. We can always add more later.2) We set a directional goal of buyers — and then work backwards. I created a marketing/launch plan spreadsheet with different marketing activities ranging from $0 to $1,000 in cost each (i.e. Product Hunt launch, cold outreach to people using competitors, Meta Ads, etc.) until it added up to my goal. The math landed on 14 activities. Most our efforts were free/unpaid.3) Post-launch, we got 100+ pieces of user feedback... bug fixes, feature requests, and more. It's EASY to say \"yes\" to everything. It's HARDER to say \"no\". At first, we handle big bugs that affect the majority of users... and then we move into longer-term improvements. We narrow down to 3-5 key features we want to add 45 days post-launch (prioritized after urgent bugs).After that, we continue our focus on serving our ICP by listening to feedback and organizing requests that align with our vision...And just keep going with consistency to make the product better. 🚀",

    "content": "AppSumo does ~$8.3M/mo in revenue.We spend $165,000/mo on software to run it.Here are the 50 most important tools in our tech stack:==1) Business Intelligence ToolsWhen you’re just starting, I recommend sticking with simple tools. You’d be surprised by how much of our business runs on Google Tools.But as you get to a larger size... it’s better to use tools like Fivetran and Tableau to analyze your data.2) Website ToolsA bunch of people mentioned they liked the design of my website.I used Webflow to design and WordPress to host my personal website.Our product team uses Splunk and Sentry to alert us if there are any issues on our site - so we can handle them quickly.3) Content ToolsBoth my personal content team and AppSumo use Frame.io to collaborate and edit our YouTube videos. We use Canva to create the graphics you may have seen on social media.We use SendFox for my weekly personal newsletter, the Million Dollar Weekend autoresponders, and for lead magnets. And Klaviyo for AppSumo to send our daily newsletter.4) Meeting ToolsWe use TidyCal to book and schedule meetings.For the actual meetings, we use Zoom. Nothing fancy here.Sometimes I forget what people say in meetings, so I use Rewind.AI to take notes.5) Sales ToolsHalf of our revenue at AppSumo comes from sending emails (which is crazy!!).Since we send so many emails, we use Mailtrap and Litmus to inspect and debug them before sending them.The sales team uses Hubspot and Clearbit - which is everything you need to generate, nurture, and close customers.We use BreezeDoc to sign contracts and documents digitally.6) Finance ToolsWe use Ramp as our company card. It helps us pay bills, stay on budget, and make payments to employees. It also has good cash-back rewards.If you’re ever thinking about giving out equity, we use Carta to track who has options and shares.7) Team ToolsWe use Atlassian to organize all of our coding projects. It stores our tickets, documentation, and meeting agendas.CleanShot to share screen-recorded feedback.Greenhouse helps us source and onboard new hires. Contra to find freelancers for our design team.We use Insperity for our human resources. They offer payroll services, tax filing, and compliance support. If you’re starting, I’d recommend Gusto.Bitwarden stores all our passwords in one place. It also has a browser extension that auto-fills the password for you.8) Productivity ToolsI do all my weekly journaling and marketing plans in BearApp.Zapier helps us automate repetitive tasks without coding.We use Circle to manage our VIP Plus community for AppSumo.Important note:While the team and I spend a lot of time testing new tools (it’s kind of our job haha)...If you’re just starting your business - it’s less about finding the perfect tool, and more about getting started.Remember: do what works for YOUR business.My full 50+ tool stack:https://lnkd.in/eqbbzGS5",

    "content": "Culture is how people behave when no one is looking.I'm the CEO of a $100 million company.Here's the exact internal culture handbook we use (bookmark this for later):1) This is YOUR companyAfter working at Intel, Facebook, and Mint, I wanted to work with adults who took ownership of their work, could get stuff done, and were a joy to work with.Kids make excuses. Adults take ownership.2) Lead by exampleA few weeks ago, I blew up at someone in a meeting. Doing that says we are okay with yelling at others.I set a poor example for everyone else.What you do becomes the behavior others imitate.3) Double down• When affiliates was working, we hired 5 more people to grow it• When lifetime deals became popular, we did only those type of dealsInstead of chasing new things, MAXIMIZE the things you know work.4) Test, then invest• Hiring a new teammate? Start with 1 month paid trial• New marketing idea? Start with a small group of customersInstead of spending a lot on something unknown, find out if it's working quickly for a low cost.5) Ask for forgiveness, not permissionAs companies get larger, rules and policies get put into place.That slows things down. No one wants to sit around waiting for their boss's boss's boss to approve their idea.6) Default to sharingOur KPI sheet, board notes, monthly business reviews, and budgets are available for all to view.People should know how the business is being run. At my previous jobs, this information was always hidden.More info = Better decisions = Better company7) Feedback is a giftIf there is a problem, we bring it up respectfully and directly. We don't go behind someone's back and sh*t talk them.We aren't always going to agree. But the best ideas come out of hard conversations and feedback.8) Never forget the tacoAppSumo is the only company I know to ask for customer reviews in tacos, not stars.'Never forget the taco' is a reminder not to become lame.Because THAT is what culture is at its core... not forgetting who you are.~~Thanks for reading!Two things:1.

    "content": "A few months ago, a high schooler sent me a 19-page slide deck on how I could improve my content.Now he runs all our social and email marketing.Here's how he landed a $150k job with me (and how you can use the same \"Pre-Work Method\" to create opportunities):It’s 2006.My buddy Dave McClure introduced me to a guy named Aaron who was building a product called mint.com (at the time it was called MyMint).I was super impressed. “This is the best product I’ve ever seen,” I told him.I noticed he was looking for a Director of Marketing - so I pitched him on why I would be a great fit.He laughed at me. “But you don’t know anything about marketing.”Fair point. So I spent the next week creating a 6-month marketing plan and launch strategy. Over 80 hours of researching online, reading Seth Godin’s books, and working on this plan for FREE.I reached back out to Aaron and said, “If you like this plan, I’ll execute it for 3 months and then you can pay me a six-figure salary.”He LOVED it! He hired me, we executed the plan, and it crushed.Only 3 years later, Mint sold for $170 to Intuit.This “permissionless” strategy works if you want to land a job, get clients, or even sell a product.Most people ask, “How can I help you?” or “What can I do to work with you?”The probability that someone will go out of their way to figure out who you are and what you can do is much lower than if you showed them that you can do the job.Think, “How do I make this a no-brainer for them?”Here’s how Jay Yang, a high schooler convinced me to pay him $150,000+ to work with me.Jay reached out to Jeremy, my former Creative Director for our YouTube channel with a 19-page pitch deck that broke down all the things that sucked about my social media and email.He also created 9 pieces of content that was ready to be published. Immediately, that showed me two things:1. He had done his homework2. He knew what he was talking aboutNow Jay runs all our social and email marketing - and is making more than his teachers while in high school.Anytime someone uses this approach, I always hire them and never regret it.5 years ago, Jeremy Mary reached out and wanted to help with my Instagram. At the time, Instagram wasn’t my priority. But he kept sending me examples of content that I could post immediately.He said, “Why don’t you let me run your Instagram for free for two more weeks, and if you like it you can start paying me.”Jeremy eventually became my YouTube producer and helped me grow the channel to over 1,000,000+ subscribers.Now he runs his own YouTube title/thumbnail agency and has an awesome podcasted called Backstage Careers.The coolest thing about this approach is you don’t have to have any experience or money to get started.All you have to do is put some effort BEFORE you reach out.If you do this enough times, I promise you you’ll get 6-7-figure opportunities.Follow Noah Kagan for more content like this! 💚",

    "content": "I was employee #30 at Facebook. Then I got fired.Now I’m the CEO of a $100 million company.10 non-obvious lessons I learned from working directly under Mark Zuckerberg:10) Focus on ONE goalMark’s goal was 1 billion users.Every idea we’d bring, he’d ask, “Does this help user growth or not?”If it wasn’t driving toward that goal, we didn’t do it.You don’t grow fast by doing many things, but by doing ONE thing extremely well.9) Move fastAt Facebook, it was normal to work 12+ hours a day.We were constantly pushing out new features and letting our users give feedback.As a startup, your biggest advantage against giant companies is speed.8) Only hire A playersMark would only hire people he would be happy to work for.Even our customer support team was filled with Harvard Ph.D.s.The people from Facebook have gone on to found Asana, Quora, AppSumo, OpenAi, and more.A startup depends on great people much more than a big company.7) Treat your employees wellFacebook did a lot of things that are the norm now.• Free lunches• Free dry cleaning• Paid for our apartments• Paid for our parking ticketsTreating your employees well improves work and boosts morale.It doesn’t have to be money – people just want to feel acknowledged.6) Scratch your own itchI used Facebook to connect with friends and meet girls.Which meant if I saw something wrong, I could fix it myself.Most people start businesses in categories they don’t have an interest in.Build selfishly, share selflessly.5) Pay attention to detailsI remember Mark sent me an email at 3 am telling me that I missed a period in one of our documents. A period (!!)Mark set a high standard of excellence for us.It was challenging, but also super rewarding.4) Give ownership to the teamSurprisingly, Mark wasn’t super involved in the day-to-day operations. He coded some of the time, but mostly was focused on the macro vision.He was great about giving people a goal, some boundaries, and coaching them from the sidelines.3) “People” not “Users”Mark would yell at us if we said “users”.“They’re human beings”, he’d tell us.On the other side of that username or email address is a fellow human.2) Hire fast, fire fastI got fired in 9 months. My boss was fired the day I started. My next boss was fired a month later.Mark was intense about keeping A players only.At AppSumo, we run paid trials with potential teammates before bringing them on full-time.1) Have a big-ass visionWe were all in our 20s when Mark was offered $1B to sell Facebook.When he said no, he sent a message to all of us and the world.His goal was to connect the ENTIRE world. That inspired the shit out of us.Follow Noah Kagan for more content like this! 💚",

    "content": "My #1 regret in life:I wish I had taken myself and dating more seriously in my 20s.8 pieces of Brutally Honest relationship advice that I’d give to my younger self (so you can avoid my mistakes):1/ Improve yourselfYou have to love yourself before you can expect someone else to. And if you don’t, it’s a BIG ask to imagine a person will love and fix you.The best way I’ve found is to focus on the things under your control:You can control your effortYou can control how you dressYou can control who you hang out withThese things don’t guarantee someone will show up on your doorstep like Uber Eats but they guarantee you’ll like yourself - and I promise over time someone else will like you too. 2/ Be binary about what you’re looking forWhen you ask people what they want in a partner, they all say the same things.“Funny. Attractive. Sweet.”Cool. But a lot of people are those things. Here’s what works better, have binary filters:• Kids or No Kids?• Jewish or Not Jewish• They want to live in BarcelonaSuper black and white.Having more clear filters makes saying no much easier. 3/ Be where the fish areInitially, I thought dating a Jewish person was a big requirement for me.So I went to Israel. LA. New York.But after dating a few Jewish women, it turned out that being Jewish wasn’t a big deal to me.The lesson is the same when you’re marketing for your business.Meet your customers where they are.My friend went to Colombia to find his wife. I met my wife in Barcelona.Where does your ideal partner live? Where are you?4/ The Dinner TestA while back, my brother asked me a question that I still remember to this day.He asked, “If you couldn’t have sex with that person, would you still be with them?”And for all of my past dates, the answer was “No”.Realize you will have at least 1,000 dinners with them.It’s important that you genuinely enjoy being with your partner, you’ll be sharing many meals together.5/ Don’t settleA while back, I got engaged to a girl because everything was moving in that direction. I thought that was what I was supposed to do.But then my business partner Chad asked, “Are you getting what you’re getting or are you getting what you want?”As adults, we often let society's norms and expectations drown out our intuition.Go to college. Get good grades. Get a ‘safe’ job. Work 40 hours a week in a boring cubicle. Work until you’re 65+. And save your best adventures until retirement.But deep down inside, we know when we’re settling.Now, I constantly ask myself, “How did I trick this woman into being with me?” I feel so lucky to be with Mafe.Continued in the comments... 👇👇",

    "content": "I’m the CEO of a $100 million business.But I’ve tried (and failed) to build 20+ startups before. Here are 10 pieces of brutally honest advice after two decades of entrepreneurship:1/ Leverage your Zone of InfluenceYour Zone of Influence is the intersection between your existing knowledge, skills, and network.To find yours, ask yourself:• What do I get paid for in my day job?• Who do I have access to in my network?• What hobbies have people commented positively on?You likely have $100,000+ worth of knowledge, skills, and experience RIGHT NOW that others would pay for.2/ Focus on ONE goalOne of the biggest lessons I learned from working directly under Mark Zuckerberg was this:Pick ONE goal… then focus relentlessly on reaching it.Mark’s goal was 1 billion users on Facebook.Every idea we’d bring, he’d always ask, “Does this help user growth or not?”I remember pitching him about doing monetization. He grabbed a marker and wrote “GROWTH” on the whiteboard.You don’t grow fast by doing many things, but by doing ONE thing extremely well.3/ The best marketing is a great productWhen I was Director of Marketing at Mint, we grew from 0 to 1 million users in 6 months.We tested many marketing strategies - PR, blogs, influencer marketing, affiliate programs, etc.But ultimately, the best marketing is a great product.Marketing was easy because we had a product that customers LOVED, not liked.First-time entrepreneurs focus on customer acquisition. Second-time entrepreneurs focus on customer retention.4/ Buyers buy againWhen I ran my conference business (CommunityNext), I didn't know how to find sponsors.So I looked at who was sponsoring OTHER conferences and reached out to them.Instead of trying to find NEW customers - find the ones who are already spending money.5/ The industry you pick mattersWhen we started AppSumo, there were ~10 SaaS tools. Now, there are 10,000+.I’ve watched super hard-working people spend years working on ideas in shrinking markets with little to show for it.WHAT you work on matters more than HOW hard you work.A growing market makes business easy. A shrinking market makes business hard.6/ Work backward from your lifestyleIn my 20s, I was obsessed with getting rich and proving Facebook wrong for firing me. But when I became a millionaire...I still found myself chasing money for the sake of money. Sometimes I still do.Far too often, I see entrepreneurs start a business for freedom but get sucked into their business and end up working MORE than if they just stuck with their day job.Don’t trade your 9-5 for a 5-9.7/ Practice LeadershipThe advice I’d give my younger self is to practice leadership.For example, start by hiring a cleaner.You learn how to agree on the money, make sure they’re responsible, and check in on them regularly.Follow Noah Kagan for more content like this!Continued in the comments... 👇👇",

    "content": "I became a millionaire by age 30 working day jobs.If you’re young, and want to become financially free…Here’s the exact 9-step playbook you can use:1/ Live below your meansI lived at MY PARENTS’ HOUSE for 2 years.Then my aunt’s basement for over a year. And then on floors for a year, all to save money.Most people spend money they don't have on lifestyles they can't afford. If you want to get rich, do the opposite.2/ Follow the 10-Year RuleGetting rich is a LONG ASS journey. It took me over 10 years.To become a millionaire, do 3 things:1. Be patient2. Work on something you love for a long time3. Start right nowBe impatient with actions and patient with results.3/ Start side hustlesWhen I was at Intel, I did a bunch of stuff on the side:→ Entrepreneur27→ CommunityNext conference→ NinjaCardWhy?With a job, your income is capped. As an entrepreneur, there are no limits!4/ Start with your zone of influenceA mistake I see is people trying to start a business in a completely unrelated industry.• What do you get paid for in your day job?• What have you gotten paid for in the past?• Who do you have access to in your network?5/ Use leverageIf you’re doing $10/hr work, how do you expect to make $1,000/hr?Competing for gigs on Fiverr is great to start, but how can you focus on vertical long-term commitments?Hire or use software to service your clients. Trade your money for other people's time.6/ Do what you enjoyThe fastest way to build wealth is to get good.And you’ll never get good at anything if you don’t stick with it over time.It took me a decade to find out you can get paid promoting things like we do on AppSumo - and a decade to get great at it.7/ Double downWhen AppSumo started making money, I devoted all of my time to it.Today, it’s 90% of my income.Most people go from thing to thing hoping to strike gold.When you find what works, do A LOT more of it.8/ Solve your own problemsMost people quit because they start generic businesses they don’t care about:• Dropshipping• Affiliate marketing• etc.PEOPLE, NO!Find something meaningful that you’re excited to work on for the next ten years and commit to it.9/ Surround yourself with the right peopleThe best career decision I made was working with inspirational people.Yet, most people focus WAY too much on their paycheck.Do whatever it takes to be around people you admire. You’ll be FAR better off in 10 years.~~🌮 Follow Noah Kagan for more content like this!💚 Share this with someone in your network who needs this!",

    "content": "Recently, we re-built our hiring process to get A-players.20+ hours later, it worked...For startups, it's CRITICALLY important to get hires right.Too many founders/executives go into hiring with a half-baked plan. (And that's a huge waste of time, energy, and money.)With our new strategy, we hired two senior-level A-players (designer and dev) — without breaking the bank.Here's our process:1) Before we started interviewing, I created a six-page document that codified our culture, new hire projects (e.g., \"Redo onboarding with less freebies, instead focusing on KPIs\"), and the why/goal behind their projects (e.g., \"2x SendFox buyers weekly\"). This helped me clarify our business wants... and also helped candidates clarify if they would want to work with us. Clarifying responsibilities and metrics is the MOST critical part of hiring... but it's what founders/executives often miss.2) We outsourced our hiring to a LatAM agency called Howdy.com. There are a lot of these nowadays (Hire With Near, RemotelyTalents, and Outwork Staffing are others I've good things about). We gave the agency the six-page culture/wants document to source the best candidates based on our wants. Using a hiring agency saved us time and money (the new hires are half the cost of similar U.S. hires).3) We created an interview scorecard to objectively evaluate. We had eight graded areas, each on a 1 (poor) to 5 (great) scale, that were aligned with our six-page document wants/needs. Some grading areas included: \"Culture: Does this person seem a great independent worker and critical thinker?\" and \"Technical: Do they check all the boxes for our technical languages, or are familiar enough with similar languages to be able to learn? (Laravel, React, Svelte, Bootstrap)?\".After all interviews, we had 42+ (!!!) pages of notes from 16+ interviews with 7+ different candidates.Most importantly, we found two strong new team members who have CLEAR projects with CLEAR KPI/OKR alignment. And expectations are aligned.By the way, if you want the six-page hiring guide I created... leave a comment below and I'll send it to you for free. 📤",

    "content": "I’ve met 25 billionaires during my career as a tech entrepreneur and YouTuber.Collectively, they’ve created over $1 trillion of value for the world.Here are the 6 biggest lessons they shared with me:1- There are no employee billionairesEvery billionaire I’ve met became a billionaire through entrepreneurship.As an employee, there’s a cap on your salary. The average annual raise is 3%.But as an entrepreneur? You’re in full control of:• What you sell• How much you charge• And how many people see your offerI’m not here to say that having a job is bad. But the truth is you’re not gonna be a billionaire with only a salary.If you want control of your income, start a business.2- Billionaires create their marketWhoever creates the market, takes home the billions.When we started AppSumo, there were ~10 SaaS tools. Now, there are tens of thousands.A growing market makes business easy. A shrinking market makes business hard.You have to be okay with looking “foolish” NOW to be right LATER.What details do you notice that most people don’t?3- They are okay with being boringYou don’t need to be in a sexy market (like tech or AI) to do well.Larry Janesky became a billionaire with basements. Michael Hudner became very wealthy with shipping containers.There are SO many ways to get rich.What do you enjoy? What do you have an advantage in?You’re much more likely to be successful when you follow your energy instead of the crowd.4- Their attitude towards money never changesWhen you think of how you’ll meet a billionaire, you probably think of seeing them off the coast of Monaco in a super yacht and wearing expensive designer clothes.But that couldn’t be further from the truth.When I met Paul Orfalea he was wearing short socks and sneakers.Zuck is notorious for wearing a simple gray t-shirt with jeans.Peter Thiel was using an old iPhone 7 and Hanes socks.They’re less concerned with LOOKING rich and more concerned with BEING rich.Money doesn’t change your character, it only reveals it.5- Billionaires got rich doing ONE thingYou don’t build wealth by diversifying. You build wealth by doing ONE thing.Mark Zuckerberg didn’t have side hustles. He built Facebook.Try a lot of things. Once you find one that works - DOUBLE DOWN!Diversification is for wealth preservation and protection, not wealth creation.6- Billionaires pay the priceMany of the billionaires I spoke with told me how they sacrificed relationships with their spouse and kids.They also said they’d give anything to have those relationships back.“You can’t get back the time with family, but you can always make more money.”Entrepreneurship is NOT just about becoming a billionaire.It’s about creating your dream life.Not everyone wants to or should become a billionaire.For me, I’ve never wanted to be a mega-billionaire or own a fleet of yachts.I wanted the freedom to work on stuff I love and be with my favorite people.",

    "content": "Please don't quit your job and \"go all in\".It’s much simpler to build a side hustle alongside your day job, hit your freedom number, and then jump ship if you want.Here’s how you can do it:Step 1: Write out your Dream YearOne of the biggest things I notice when I speak with people is they DON’T BELIEVE they can live their dream life.The more you write it out, look at it, and think about it - I promise you - you deserve and can have that life!What does \"freedom\" actually mean to you?When you realize you are the author of your life then you realize you can make it a true story.Step 2: Let your Hate, motivate!Next, write out everything that irritates you about where you are right now.• My boss keeps interrupting me while I eat my tacos• My work doesn’t give me the creative freedom• The traffic to work SUCKSStep 3: Set your Freedom NumberYour Freedom Number is the amount of money you need to be earning on the side to quit your day job comfortably.My monthly Freedom Number was $3,000.Your Freedom Number is LOWER than you realize and also SMALLER than you expected.Step 4: Start with your zone of influenceA mistake I see people make is trying to start a business in a completely unrelated industry to what they’re familiar with.They have a job as an accountant but try to start a business making software for Content Creators.Instead, use your pre-existing skills, knowledge, and network.• What do you get paid for in your day job?• What have you gotten paid for in the past?• Who do you have access to in your network?Step 5: Give up 1 Netflix show a week.Block off a non-negotiable 60-min block each day to work on your escape plan.This is YOUR time to build new skills and explore side projects.Don’t have 60 minutes?Ok, answer this:Could you wake up 30 minutes earlier?Could you sacrifice 1 episode of Netflix?Could you reduce your screen time by 20 minutes?If creating your dream life is a priority, then treat it like a priority.Step 6: Make your first $1The validation stage is about speed. Don’t overthink the design, name, or logo. Just focus on seeing if you can get people to buy your product!1. Make it easy: start with your best friends and family members who might be interested.2. Collect money upfront: the promise of payment is not validation… that’s a polite rejection. Everyone’s “interested” until they have to pay.3. Views rejections as a GIFT: every rejection is an opportunity to take a deep dive into customer problems.Many struggle to make their first dollar because they are so focused on how to make their first million.Think NOW, not HOW.Step 7: Live a Low-Cost LifestyleI saved money by staying in my aunt’s basement. I even slept on couches for a whole year.Most people spend money they don't have on lifestyles they can't afford. If you want to build wealth, do the opposite.@ramit's book is great for this!Continued in the comments 👇👇",

    "content": "9 images that will make you a better entrepreneur:(Visuals by Lewis O’Brien)1. Think NOW, not HOWMany struggle to make their first dollar because they focus too much on making their first million. Sure, plan ahead.But don’t get so caught up in the future that you forget to act in the present.2. Test, then investInstead of spending a lot on something unknown, find out if it’s working quickly for a low cost: • Hiring a new teammate? Start with 1 month paid trial.• Buying new software? Start with 1 month, not a full year.• New marketing idea? Start with a small group of customers.Once you validate your idea on a small scale, then invest big time.3. Persistence pays offThere’s no such thing as an overnight success.Every “overnight success” story is actually a story of years of hard work and persistence.No one became a billionaire in 24 hours.4. The more shots you take, the 'luckier' you getTry lots of things.Throw shit at the wall. Most won’t stick. Some will.The ones that win pay for the losses 10x over.In business, you only need to be right ONCE to win.5. Diversification is a mythOne of the biggest lessons I learned from working directly under Mark Zuckerberg was this:Pick ONE goal.Then focus relentlessly on reaching it.You don’t grow fast by doing many things, but by doing ONE thing extremely well.6. Choose your freedom numberYour Freedom Number is the amount of money you need to earn on the side to quit your day job comfortably.Mine was $3000/mo.Make yours:• Doable• Urgent• Specific7. The Golden Rule of MarketingA great product makes marketing easy. A poor product makes marketing hard.The best marketing has been and will always be a great product.8. Failure = FeedbackEvery quarter, I ask people I work with 2 questions:1. What are Top 3 things I’m doing well that I should continue?2. What are Bottom 3 things I should improve on?Then I print out the feedback and keep it next to my desk to remind myself.9. Never forget who you areAs your business grows larger, it's easy to take the bland, safe route.It's death by a thousand cuts.AppSumo is the only company I know to ask for customer reviews in tacos, not stars.'Never forget the taco' is a reminder to not become lame.Shoutout Lewis O’Brien for the awesome visuals! 💚",

    "content": "I’m the CEO of a $100 million business.But the first 10 years of my career:• Rejected by Google (2x)• Fired by FB after 9 months• Built 10+ startups that didn’t work outHere are 18 pieces of brutally honest career advice (I wish I knew earlier):1/ It’s okay to feel lost. When you’re in your 20s, you’re not supposed to know exactly what you want to do with your career. Instead of trying to predict your career path, focus on taking daily action.2/ Take more swings. Early on, you can afford to take more risks because you have fewer obligations. Do free work to get your foot in the door. Fly across the country to meet with an investor. Start the crazy business idea with your roommate. You only need ONE to win.3/ Be the hub. When I graduated, I hosted meetups and conferences…even when I didn’t know anyone. The people I helped like Ramit Sethi, Tim Ferriss, and Ryan Holiday ended up helping me 15 years down the line. Ask the smartest people you know, “Who is ONE person I should meet?’4/ Document your learning online. Creating content is a career cheat code. I’ve been writing on my personal blog since 2000 (!!) Worst case? You learn how to write and promote your work. Best case? You attract life-changing opportunities.5/ Learn copywriting. Copywriting is not about hitting a word count or writing a five-paragraph essay. It’s about capturing attention and persuading action. You will never be disappointed by improving your communication skills.6/ Master the art of the cold email. I’ve been sending cold emails since I was a freshman. The best cold emails: Get to the point. Instantly grab attention. Answer “What’s in it for me?” If you shoot 100 shots, you’re bound to land one hit.7/ Mentors are overrated. The best way to find a mentor? Become someone worth mentoring. Start things. Encounter a problem. Ask for SPECIFIC feedback, not advice. Report back on how you did. Repeat. You’ll realize you never needed a “mentor” in the first place.8/ Build independent income streams. Getting fired at Facebook taught me that EVERYONE is replaceable. Start more side hustles. You’ll learn more, earn independent income, and maybe even replace your income to go full-time.9/ Give way less f*cks about other people. No amount of money, followers, or acknowledgment will quench your thirst for fulfillment. The people you’re trying to impress aren’t even thinking about you in the first place. Don't prove others wrong. Prove yourself right.10/ Have more patience. In my 20s, I was impatient to get rich and famous. I beat myself up a ton. That’s a miserable way to live. You don’t have to be so hard on yourself. If you’re doing the reps, the results WILL pay off. Be impatient with actions and patient with results.Continued in the comments 👇👇",

    "content": "Being an introvert is NOT a disadvantage.How to get rich (even if you're an introvert):Many people believe introversion is about being shy, awkward, or unconfident.But that’s not the case at all.Introversion is about where you get your energy from.And some of the world’s richest people are introverts.Zuck, Elon,  Bezos…Introversion is NOT a disadvantage.In fact, when leveraged correctly, it can be an advantage.Here's how:1- You don't need to be extroverted to succeedThe internet gives ANYONE the chance to have the same broadcasting power as a massive media brand.For example, I had Dan Koe on my podcast. He’s making $4M+/year with writing and education products.I also had Brett From Design Joy on the pod. He runs a $2M+/year solo design subscription agency.The point is:You can get rich in MANY ways as an introvert.2- Partner With ExtrovertsSome of the most successful companies were started by people with complementary skill sets.• Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak at Apple• Gates and Allen at Microsoft• Chad and me at AppSumo 😉Surround yourself with people who complement your strengths.3- Optimize For IntroversionWhen you do have to do more ‘extroverted’ things, create rules to optimize for your introversion:1. Schedule BreaksEvery meeting is 30-45 minutes.That leaves 15-30 minutes between meetings to be by myself and recharge.2. Take A Day OffI take Saturdays off to rest, recharge, and spend time with family.I don’t check social media, Slack, or my email.Just like you have 'rest days' in the gym, build 'rest days' into your work schedule.3. Create Personal RulesFew people give you a hard time when you say you have a personal rule.\"I have a personal rule that I don’t do weekly Zoom calls with clients. But I’ll write you a weekly report and we can chat async.”Set clear boundaries. Then communicate them to others.4- Build Relationships With Other IntrovertsThe truth is great entrepreneurs have great entrepreneurial communities.There’s no such thing as self-made.Everyone is network-made.When you do communicate - keep a tight filter:• Text before you call• Call before you Zoom• Zoom before you meet in person.Just because someone asks for your time doesn’t mean they're entitled to it.5- Extroversion is A SkillDon’t expect to be perfect at the start.Just focus on taking the smallest step in the right direction.Host an event → host a small dinner with close friends.Get on stage in front of 100 people → talk to 1 person.Ask someone on a date → give a compliment to a stranger.You can’t improve what you don’t start.Getting outside of yourself is a SKILL that you improve at with time and practice.It’s possible to be successful as an introvert.It’s possible to become a confident, charismatic speaker.It’s possible to build the business of your dreams YOUR way. But you have to start NOW.~~~Follow Noah Kagan for more content like this!Share to help your network",

    "content": "My $80M company has over 100 teammates. Here are 8 principles we instill into our culture from our internal AppSumo handbook (that you can steal):1- This is your company.If I had to summarize our entire culture into one point, it would be it. We hire adults that we trust to embrace this mindset.After working at Intel, Facebook, and Mint, I realized what I wanted above all was to work with adults who took ownership of their work, could get stuff done, and were a joy to work with.2- Lead by example.What you do becomes the behavior others imitate.Recently I blew up at someone in a meeting. Doing that says we are okay with yelling at others. Or when I was 5 minutes late to a team sync. That sets a poor example for everyone. These were areas I’m improving as a leader setting the example.If you want people to give more praise to others, then SET the example and praise often.3- Double down.When something is working, we double down on it.• Affiliates as a marketing channel was working, we hired 5 additional people to grow this. • When lifetime deals became super popular, we decided to only do those types of deals. Instead of chasing new things, MAXIMIZE the things you know work.4- Test, then invest.Instead of spending a lot on something unknown, find out if it’s working quickly for a low cost:• Hiring a new teammate? Start with 1 month paid trial.• Buying new software? Start with 1 month, not a full year.• New marketing idea? Start with a small group of customers.Once we can validate our idea on a small scale, then invest big time.5- Ask for forgiveness, not permission.As most companies get larger, rules and policies get put into place.But no one wants to sit around waiting for their boss’s boss’s boss to approve their idea. Good judgment > Good process6- Default to Sharing.Our KPI sheet, board notes, monthly business reviews and budgets are available for all to view.Why? Because people should know how the business is being run. At my previous jobs, this information was always hidden.By sharing the info, people learn more and make better decisions. 7- Feedback is a gift.Feedback is encouraged.If there is a problem, we bring it up respectfully and directly. We don’t go behind someone’s back and sh*t talk them.Feedback allows us to improve. We aren’t always going to agree. In fact, we often ask others to play devil’s advocate for our ideas so that we know we’re covering all the bases.The best ideas come out of hard conversations and feedback.8- Never forget the taco.As we’ve gotten larger, it’s easy to take the bland, safe route.‘Never forget the taco’ is a reminder to not become lame. That is what culture is at its core… Never forget who you are.Hope this gives you some ideas for your own company culture. 💚 If you enjoyed this, I share more in my newsletter: noahkagan.comCheck out our full AppSumo Culture Handbook: https://lnkd.in/eP3v5rha",

    "content": "I’m the CEO of an $80M company. But the first 10 years of my career, I was rejected by Google, fired by Facebook after 9 months, and built 10+ startups that failed...Here are 7 pieces of career advice that I wish I knew earlier - 1. Geography mattersIf you want to play in the major leagues, you’ve got to BE in the major leagues.• Aspiring country singer? Go to Nashville.• Want to be in tech? Go to the Bay Area.• Trying to get into acting? Go to LA.Go where it’s happening. And if you can’t be there physically, figure out how to connect online first.2. Document your learning onlineI started blogging in 2000 when I used to have hair (lol).It help you process what you’ve learned, and you’ll build your brand and meet cool people.They’ll come to you with ideas and even job offers, rather than you having to go begging with a resume.3. Go after the biggest failuresToo many people are scared of failing.But you need to push to this point to get the biggest possible growth and learning.In my career, almost everything has not worked.But the truth is… you only have to be right once to build a successful business.4. Find someone who has walked your ideal pathIf you can find a mentor who is ahead of you in life, it’s way easier to see if that’s what you want too. You’ll save yourself many mistakes.My advice? Create value for them BEFORE you make an ask.5. Figure out what you are an expert inFind your superpower…then 10x it.Surround yourself (or hire people) to complement your weaknesses.I’m great at igniting and marketing, but struggle with consistency and sticking with things.So I surround myself with people who move forward in the things that I’m not good at.6. Chase opportunities, but slow down for successIn my 20s, I chased to become a millionaire with Facebook games and payments, but hated it.When my company got sued and banned by Facebook, sounds terrible but I was actually relieved. It gave me the excuse to try more fulfilling things.In your 20s, try a bunch of stuff. But when you find the thing that works, slow down and enjoy it.7. Be the hubI’d bet 80% of my net worth is because of relationships and people I know.When I graduated UC Berkeley in 2004, I started hosting dinners and beer meetups, even when I didn’t know anyone.The interesting people I helped and connected at the time, like Ramit Sethi, Tim Ferriss, and Ryan Holiday helped me 15 years down the line.Spend one hour a week meeting and helping people with no expectations.BONUS: Be intentional about partner selectionBoth your business partner and life partner matters a ton. Who you’re with can either drag you down or lift you up.The big three in life are WHERE you live, WHAT you do and WHO you do it with.What else is good career advice that every young person should hear?If this could help someone you know, share it ♻️ and follow me Noah Kagan for more!I also share the best stuff in my newsletter: noahkagan.com",

    "content": "Over the last several weeks, you've probably seen something about Noah Kagan and his new book, Million Dollar Weekend.If you're in the same bubble as me, you've probably seen a LOT about it! Since the launch, he's been on the Tim Ferriss Show, School of Greatness, Deep Dive with Ali Abdaal, and a whole lot more. As a result, Million Dollar Weekend has already made the New York Times bestseller list.Noah is the CEO of AppSumo, an 8 figure company that is the #1 software deals site. He also runs a YouTube channel where he shares his tips for finding financial freedom with more than 930,000 subscribers.Before AppSumo, he was the 30th employee at Facebook reporting directly to Mark Zuckerberg and the fourth employee at Mint.Noah has built this reputation for being a relentless tinkerer. He's constantly running small experiments – often, marketing experiments.This week, he's on the Creator Science Podcast too. But in this episode, you'll learn about his experience making the book itself. How he landed a publishing deal (after initially getting rejected by his agent), how big of an advance he got (after being the subject of a bidding war), and even how he landed his cowriter, Tahl Raz.Tune in wherever you get your podcasts: https://lnkd.in/gVeqKrt9",

    "content": "Part 2 of 2: My A/B testing process revealed 📚 The clear winner in both polls for the subtitle of my book was “The surprisingly simple way to launch a 7-figure business in 48 hours.”[if you haven't read Part 1 first, read that first: https://lnkd.in/dGeXXe_g ]This is what ended up on the final version. You don’t need a large audience to do these tests - the whole point is to TEST so you can use some insights on making better decisions.Next, I wanted to decide the color for the book.We used ads again to test. This time, the covers were the same, it was just a difference in color. We tested black, blue, yellow, and green. Thank you Nick Christensen and Top Growth Marketing for helping setup all the FB tests.We tested a few times to make sure. After 1M impressions, yellow actually came out on top, but there wasn’t a significant difference between yellow and green. So I made the call to choose green because it’s the color I’ve used on my blog for years.4- Look through the eyes of your customerWhen I told my publisher I wanted to choose green, they didn’t think it was a good idea. They said green is bad luck (who knew?) and that we’d be the only green book in the business category.That made me double take. Being different is scary. It meant it could either go really well or really poorly.While making my book a bright green might have been a riskier move, when we placed the mockups against all the other business books on the bookshelves, green really popped.These mockups affirmed my decision. We even did a mockup of the book on Amazon, and it was clear that the green was the right decision.5- SIZE mattersOne last tweak we made to the book cover, Dan Martell told me to look at the book from afar. Could people walking by a bookstore still see the title? The answer was no, so we made the title much larger to stand out even more for the final version.All of these tests and iterations allowed us to get to the final version that people have been loving. 💚The difference between those who get good results and those who get great results is a commitment to constant asking, testing and improving.In your business, what’s something you can test and improve?---If you liked this deep dive, reshare ♻️ and follow me Noah Kagan for more.

    "content": "Part 1 of 2: My A/B testing process revealed 📚My friend Neville Medhora wrote a tweet about how I “split tested” my way to the color of the cover for Million Dollar Weekend.Here's a deep dive into how we used A/B testing and data to iterate our way to the current cover (and how you can apply it for your business).1- Finish StrongWhether we want to believe it or not, people DO judge a book by its cover. And if they never pick up your book because the cover sucks, they’ll never get to the good stuff inside.By the time my publishers sent me 50 book covers to review, I had already spent years writing and rewriting the contents of the book. We were getting close to launch, and it would have been easy to just pick one of the covers provided.But my mother always told me to “finish strong” - you always forget how hard you ran after the race is over. Last lap matters most. Why work so hard on your product, only to not do the marketing?When I spoke with James Clear, he told me that he tested 300 different book covers. 300!So I knew that it was essential to have everything–the title, subtitle, color, font, and graphics–dialed in.2- Test, Test, then Test Some MoreThe easiest way to improve your business is to ASK. You can do it with data and you can do it qualitatively with customer opinion. Testing should NOT replace you making decisions but inform better decision making.We set up inexpensive FB ad campaigns by running them in affordable countries. In total, we spent $377 on 7.8M impressions that garnered 50k clicks ($.007 a click), targeting men aged 18-65 in China, India, and Singapore who speak English.Then we looked at the clickthrough rate for each cover. The covers that performed the best included the ‘snapping fingers’ graphic, Million Dollar Weekend with a golden ticket, and Million Dollar Weekend with a calendar.Next, we tested our top results against each other in 5 more iterations of the ad test. The ‘snapping fingers’ graphic won with a 0.83% clickthrough rate. Nice!3- ‘Broken Door Problem’I felt confident about using the ‘snapping fingers’ graphic and liked that it represented taking action quickly. But there was more to consider, like the subtitle, and background color.For a long time, the subtitle was “Build a business so quickly there’s no time to chicken out.” When something in your life has been the same for a while, it’s easy just to leave it as it is. I call this the ‘Broken Door Problem.’ But I’ve found that the best entrepreneurs stay curious and wonder if things can improve.So I did a poll on both Twitter and my email newsletter, testing different variations. What was the winner? Go to Part 2: https://lnkd.in/dsSjjdzG---If you liked this deep dive, reshare ♻️ and follow me Noah Kagan for more.

    "content": "My biggest lesson from writing Million Dollar Weekend? We all can do harder things than we realize. Writing a book is hard. Building a business is hard. But they’re not impossible. Here's 5 reflections from creating my book:1- Success leaves CluesWriting a book takes YEARS (took me 4). And it’ll be around for the rest of your life.So I learned to talk to others who have already done it. I collected advice from James Clear, Tim Ferriss, Ramit Sethi to check if this was really for me.When I did start, Tahl Raz (co-author) had me write 30 reports on top entrepreneurship books: what they did well, what could be improved.You can shortcut success by looking at the breadcrumbs of the greats. 2- Build WITH your customersMost people hear the word “author” and they think of a lone writer clacking at a typewriter in the woods. Not only is that BORING, it’s ineffective.I applied my marketing strategies (from Million Dollar Weekend) to create the book WITH my customers. After draft 1, early readers pointed out what was missing and what I needed to double down on.We ALL have gaps in our thinking. Fill those gaps with your audience, getting feedback, and iterating. All the way to the first sale.3- Work backwards from your goalI planned the book marketing 18 months in advance (James Clear advice).We used a spreadsheet to coordinate podcasts/content, secure bulk buys, track Launch Team growth, and forecast sales. Marketing your product should not be a surprise. Once we set our goal (25,000 book sales in 30 days), we could plan to get there. This coordinated a huge marketing effort that drove tons of sales.4- We can do hard thingsI hired Tahl Raz so I wouldn’t have to write the book all myself. Got Charlie Hoehn to work his editing magic and got feedback from 1,000+ beta readers. Thought I was learning to delegate better. In reality, I was scared that my book wouldn’t help people. So I tried to avoid most of the work.That came to a head when my publisher said the book was due in 2 wks. I read the latest version and couldn’t honestly put my name on the cover. I had to face myself.So I worked 15 hr days to improve. Meticulously went over every word. Got feedback from people 1 by 1. Gained confidence that my book could actually help change peoples lives.You can do hard things. But you have to face the thing you’ve been avoiding.5- Focus on the input, not the outputFirst time I checked my book’s Amazon ranking was the morning of the book launch (peaked at 18). I reminded myself constantly to focus on the inputs in my control eg. How many social posts I create, emails/DMs I reply to, etc.Get joy and reward from the inputs - we will sustain longer and results will come.This book is my life’s work. It’s everything I’ve learned in entrepreneurship in one place. If you’re willing to take a chance on yourself, the world wants you to win. 💚Reshare ♻️ and follow me Noah Kagan for more.

I don’t want to be told what I can and can’t wear. I don’t want to see any more boring gray hallways.There has to be another way to live.In those 8 minutes, I decided I needed to change my path. I didn’t know exactly what I was going to do or where it would lead, but I knew that I didn’t want to be where I was.“Let me at least START something!”At Intel, I started hosting events and conferences that I called Entrepreneur 27, and I kept starting things on the side.Two decades later, I’ve built:• Eight +$1M dollar businesses• A popular YouTube channel• And become good friends with people I never dreamed I’d ever meet.In those 8 minutes, I made a decision that changed the trajectory of my life. And so can you.I’ve spent the last 3 years writing a book to help people, just like my past self, take action and build a life of freedom.Today is LAUNCH day for Million Dollar Weekend.

    "content": "I caught up with Pat Gostek on my podcast. He recently quit his day job after building a side business to $24k a month (!).He joined the Launch Team for my new book Million Dollar Weekend back in August.At the time, Pat worked 60 hours/week in customer success for a startup. But he had his sights on starting his own agency and working for himself.He got early access to my book and started using the concepts right away. Here are 3 lessons learned that Pat shared:1) In 40 years, you’ll regret not trying. This thought helped push Pat to start and keep going even through rejections along the way. Don’t spend years dwelling on ideas without taking action.2) It only takes 48 hours to test your idea. This is how he broke free of procrastination. Normally he would have spent weeks planning but with this time limit, he reached out to potential customers right away (example of his outreach in the photo).3) Sales is not evil. Pat was able to get over his fear of asking for money by reframing sales as helping people save time and make money. This made his first sale feel way easier than he thought it was going to be.Link to the full conversation below 👇",

    "content": "Million Dollar Marketing strategy Part 2 - (continued from Part 1, read that first)Step 3: Break down the goal (by marketing method)In May 2023, 9 months ahead of launch, I planned my marketing strategy (same framework I used at Mint, AppSumo, and YouTube channel).Here are the 5 marketing methods I used: 1- Build a launch team of 1,000 true fans. The advice I got from Tim Ferriss was to involve early readers. People want to be a part of your journey, not just watch from the sidelines.We brought 1,000+ fans into a Slack group and crowdsourced feedback by putting each book chapter into a Google doc where they could leave comments.As the book progressed, we sent out sneak peeks, marketing ideas, and weekly updates. This was by FAR the most helpful strategy to get customer feedback. Once the book launches, I will ask every person for a review.2- Leverage existing assets. Over the past 15 years, I’ve built assets like my email list and AppSumo.But you don’t need a huge audience. Check the assets you already have, every LinkedIn connection, contact list, friends. There are WAY more people there to help than you realize.Then, give your people an incentive for their support. With Million Dollar Weekend, we are doing book-exclusive incentives. “Buy x, get y”. • We researched bonuses that other popular books offered• We ran our incentives by our launch team• We chose bonuses that were both fun and helpful3- Create a Dream 10 list. There were 10 podcasts I wanted to go on that I knew could make a big difference. For each show, I made a list of Q&A's we could cover that would appeal to their specific audience. I also sent title & thumbnail so they could visualize how EASY it would be to have me as a guest. I asked 8 months before launch, followed up, but still faced a lot of rejection. I ended up getting 8 of my Dream 10.4- Work with Prefluencers. I looked for people with niche, rapidly growing audiences in 3 categories: entrepreneurship, real estate, and personal finance. They are easier to get replies from without an existing relationship and their audiences tend to be more engaged.3 ways I found Prefluencers (like Rose Han, Ben Meer, Nick Hutchison):• Asked my audience for shows I should be on• Asked each podcast host after our interview• Googled podcasts similar authors went on for their book tour (like Ali Abdaal)I found 150 people, then reached out asking to give an early copy of my book, collaborate on content, and just connect. Over 50% were excited to be a part of the book (yay!)5- Ask for ‘Bulk Buys’. It's MUCH easier to sell 1,000 books 1 time than to sell 1 book 1,000 times! I looked up everyone who sponsored my podcast or similar ones, every friend who runs a company or co-working space.It’s about focusing on high-leverage actions where a bit of effort gets an outsized return.The marketing I did for my book is the SAME method I’ve used for each of the eight $1M+ businesses I’ve started. Hope it helps!",

    "content": "Million Dollar Marketing strategy Part 1 -Marketing can be broken down into 3 steps:1- Make a great product.2- Set a clear goal with a timeline.3- Break down the goal (by marketing method).Here's the exact process I used to market my new book Million Dollar Weekend (and how you can apply this strategy to market ANY product… it’s what I share in Chapter 8 of my book). Step 1: Make a great book/product.99% of the time people think they have a marketing problem when they have a product problem. When I spoke with best-selling authors like Tim Ferriss, James Clear, Ramit Sethi, they all told me the same thing: The most important marketing strategy is writing a great book. Tactics and gimmicks may work in the short-term, but to be a long-term success, the book has to be great. Word of mouth is the primary driver of sales.How did I make sure Million Dollar Weekend was a product people wanted?• Wrote a blog post on Tim Ferriss’ site in 2011 that went viral• Helped 10,000+ people via my Monthly1K course• Hired my favorite best-selling author, Tahl Raz• Got feedback on every single word in the book from 1,000+ beta readers • Ran free weekend cohorts for 6 months helping people take action using the bookEach step was validation that I was on the right track.Step 2: Set clear goals with a timeline.Goals should be exciting enough to get you out of bed in the morning, but realistic enough that you can take action on them. Something I learned from Zuckerberg and use across every one of my businesses is setting ONE clear goal.My #1 goal for this book was to get 1,000 Amazon reviews.To hit this goal, I did 2 things:• For 2 years, on YouTube office hours, emails, and podcasts I said something like, “If you’re interested in hearing about my book, email me”. ~500 emailed and about 75% converted into buyers. • Then, I posted on Twitter and LinkedIn asking people to DM me or leave a comment if they wanted to join my book launch team. I messaged every single person and asked them to pre-order the book to get access. About 50% said yes.Many entrepreneurs won’t “do things that don’t scale” because they think they’re ‘above’ the 1:1 work. Long-term it’s not scalable (lots of late nights messaging)... BUT I LOVED IT! After we secured the 1,000 reviews, I set a new goal to sell 25,000 books during launch week. I want Million Dollar Weekend to help as many people as it can to start businesses and achieve freedom. And data shows if authors can hit 10,000+ sales, the book will likely gain momentum and sell more. So I wanted to focus mucho attention on getting the book snowball rolling. Hence I initially targeted 10,000 sales. But Ramit told me to “dream a little bigger”, so I upped my goal to 25,000. This forced me to prioritize high-leverage marketing activities. With 25,000 as the target, we had to work backward to plan HOW to get there...(I'll post Part 2 next!)",

    "content": "Where did the idea for my new book Million Dollar Weekend come from? I started blogging in 2000 (yes I’m a dinosaur 🦖) and shared tactical things like my “Mint Marketing Plan” (growing to 1,000,000 users) and how I start businesses. I built most of my businesses over just one weekend without spending much money. People were surprised how quickly I went from idea to reality. So I made a course called Monthly1K to teach people how to do it.Monthly1K turned into a million dollar business. People loved it, it helped them overcome rejection and get their first dollar. Most people were capable, but lacked the right mindset. People love to make excuses about why they haven’t created their dream business or even gotten started. I kept it simple. My \"business plan\" for most people is to try to get 3 paying customers within 48 hours. Normal business books are too complicated for most people to get started. That's why I wrote my own book. I wanted to show people that they can start million dollar businesses in just one weekend. 🚀",

    "content": "I dreamed of working with Tahl Raz for decades. He’s the writer behind two of my favorite books (Never Split The Difference & Never Eat Alone).After no response from cold emails, I finally got his attention on LinkedIn, and after a call, he agreed to help me write my new book Million Dollar Weekend. I thought that if I could combine his writing skills with my book idea, we could create something really special.We booked a cabin in the woods for 5 days to finish the first draft. I was excited to work with Tahl, but on the first day, he called my book proposal bullsh*t (ouch).It stung. But he was right.Tahl pushed me and challenged me constantly. From this, I learned his best-selling writing process:• Study the best. We conducted book reports on the top 30 books in our category. Tahl said, if we are writing this book - it had to be #1 in the entrepreneurship category.• Get to the core. Break down each chapter on human-sized pieces of paper to clarify the ‘aha’ moment, unique angle, and compelling story. This was to make sure there was 0 bullsh*t in the book!• Stories are memorable. Specifically, vulnerable stories are what gets remembered in a book. Focus deeply on this!• The process is never pretty. People romanticize the process of writing a book, thinking the first draft will be perfect. In reality, it takes edit after edit after edit to get it right. Over the course of the book, we cut 20,000 words.• Include your customers in the process. The final ⅓ of finishing the book was beta readers which quickly highlighted points of confusion and which parts were most impactful. Thanks everyone! From Tahl, I learned a ton about book writing. But what I wasn’t expecting was how much I learned about myself.I faced serious imposter syndrome throughout this entire process. Sometimes I doubted the entire book.Hiring Tahl, in some ways, was to avoid doing the hard work of facing the material and seeing if I could really put a book together to help people. But after positive feedback from thousands of beta readers started coming in, I realized I could do it.Million Dollar Weekend is for all the people willing to take a chance on themselves (including myself).Check out my conversation with Tahl Raz on what went into writing Million Dollar Weekend: Apple Podcasts – https://lnkd.in/ehkXyugb Spotify – https://lnkd.in/eWtDY6j3",

    "content": "Recorded the Million Dollar Weekend audiobook in Nov.It took 24 full hours…It was more difficult than I thought (and I’ve been doing YT and podcast for years)It was totally worth it though.Enjoy my soothing voice when it comes out on Jan 30. 😉A few things I learned:1/ Make sure to have professional producer with you - game changer - I had Scott Sherratt2/ Speaking clearly is more important than speaking slowly or fast.3/ Plan out if you want to do unscripted or share extra to audio listeners (“this is just for your audio listeners”) - I didn’t do this and wish I did4/ Quality is key. It’s worth paying for studio (~$300 / day)- included sound engineer and $5k microphone among other things.5/ Redo your intro on your last day - you know what you’re doing and the intro is the first part people listen to6/ Compare comments from other audiobooks in your category, we researched all comments to pick out themes people liked and hated.7/ Review your book BEFORE audiobook. You’re going to notice errors when reading and the more you can eradicate that BEFORE you start audio recording the better8/ Bring a comfortable chair or make sure the one in studio is9/ Bring chapstick, not sure why. Lips super chapped10/ LOTS of caffeine, was surprised how draining 5+ hours of recording became11/ I bought entrepreneur’s secret but any throat spray will doBtw - if you’re interested… you can check out my new book (and the juicy bonuses ($$) if you pre-order before Jan 30) here: https://lnkd.in/e9xmfRPF",

    "content": "A 21-year-old follower recently messaged me for career advice.Here are 9 pieces of career advice I shared:1. Work in different verticals — I learned social networks at Facebook, finance at Mint, and now tech tools at AppSumo. The more diverse your experiences, the more you meet interesting people and learn transferable skills.2. Geography matters — If you want to play in the major leagues, you’ve got to go where it's happening. I grew up 2 miles from the Apple campus surrounded by A players working on startups.• Want to be in tech? Bay Area.• Aspiring country singer? Nashville.• Acting? LA.If you can’t be there physically yet, get it online first, eg connecting with people already there.3. Learn outside of your skillset — Those who combine multiple skills have enormous leverage. I learned foresight from chess and applied that to content creation. At AppSumo, we started doing giveaways after being inspired by women's magazines. Find inspiration outside and bring it inside. 4. Document your learning online — I started blogging in 2000 when I used to have hair (lol). When people get to know and like you online, they’ll come to you with ideas and even job offers, rather than you begging with a resume.5. Go after the biggest failures — You need to push to the point of failure to get the biggest possible growth and learning. For me, almost everything has not worked. But you only need to be right once to build a successful business. Every failure is one step closer to winning.6. Find someone who has walked your ideal path — Find a mentor (and make it worth their while) who is ahead of you in life. It makes it easy to see if that’s what you want. You’ll save yourself time and mistakes.7. Figure out what you are an expert in — Find your superpower then 10x it. Surround yourself (or hire people) to complement your weaknesses. I’m great at igniting and marketing, but struggle with consistency so I found complementary people to work with. 8. Chase opportunities, but slow down for success — In your 20s, try everything. But when you find the thing that works, slow down and enjoy it.I chased money for 3 years in games and payments, but hated it. When my company got sued and banned by Facebook, I was relieved. It gave me the excuse to go after more fulfilling work. It’s too easy to give up on things that you don’t care about. When you’ve found something you really like, stick with it.9. Be the hub — I’d bet 80% of my net worth is because of people I know. When I graduated UC Berkeley in 2004, I started hosting dinners and conferences…even when I didn’t know anyone. The people I connected with, like Ramit Sethi, Tim Ferriss, and Ryan Holiday helped me 15 years down the line. One way to start: Spend at least one hour a week just meeting and helping people with no expectations.What else is good career advice that every young person should hear?If this could help someone you know, please share and follow me Noah Kagan for more!",

    "content": "👋 Hey, Noah here. Reflecting a bit for 2024.Wanted to reintroduce myself for people who don’t know me because it’s been one heck of a ride. Maybe it’ll help you as you think about your career/goals for this year.I worked for Facebook and Mint very early on, and got fired from both jobs. Felt like a failure but it wasn’t my path. Created companies, many didn’t work out, but kept going and eventually created 8 million-dollar companies.One of these companies, AppSumo, I grew to $80M. It’s one of my proudest accomplishments.How did I get here?My father came to America and sold carpets at Sears. My stepfather was an engineer. They influenced me towards entrepreneurship + tech.I grew up in Silicon Valley and lived 2 miles from the Apple campus. Graduated from UC Berkeley in 2004 and applied to big companies. Microsoft and Google rejected me so I began my career at Intel as a supply chain operations analyst.Then got hired at Facebook as employee #30 in 2005 when I was 24. Helped launch mobile and status updates. Facebook was my whole life, I was devastated to be fired after 9 months after my skills and attitude didn’t match what they wanted.In 2006, I joined Mint as employee #4 and led growth to 1 million users within 1 year. I was fired after 10 months after I kept dreaming of starting my own biz.Getting fired twice from companies that made it big was rough. If I stayed at Facebook and vested the 0.1% equity that was part of my compensation package, it would have been worth $900M today. 😭It was a huge learning. I hated working for other people. I'd side hustled since college, creating one company after another. That’s what I loved to do.Even while at Intel, I started an entrepreneur network, Entrepreneur27, where I hosted happy hours, and a conference business, CommunityNext, pulling in $50,000/event doing what I would have done for free, inviting people like Keith Rabois, Andrew Chen, Max Levchin, David O. Sacks, and Tim Ferriss to speak.I made entrepreneurship my full-time work. By June 2007, I founded KickFlip, which became Gambit, the #2 payments company for Facebook games. We had 40M users and $18M in revenue.But then Facebook banned Gambit and our revenue dropped 90% overnight. Ouch. It forced me to reflect. I realized I hated games and payments and it was time to move on.I loved promoting and software deals and combined them when I started AppSumo in March 2010. In one weekend, with $60, I launched v1 of the site. People loved it. 13 years later, AppSumo has grown into an 8-figure business. 🚀Along the way, I built 5 more million-dollar businesses including Monthly1k, which was a course on how to start a business that earns $1k+ a month. That was a success so I started writing a book 3 years ago to help even more people, and I started a YouTube channel.I turn 42 in February, doing what I love to do, promoting software deals for entrepreneurs and inspiring people to create businesses.Life is good. 2024, LFG. 👏",

    "content": "Morgan Housel is the author of two best-selling books and a partner at Collaborative Fund. I had him on my podcast and we talked everything from writing tips to personal finance.Here are 7 of my fav ideas from our conversation:1. Stories are memorable. If you want people to remember an idea, tell a story.2. Remove the fluff. The more concise your writing, the easier it is to digest. Less words, more impact 😆 3. It’s not how much you earn, it’s how much you keep. “What are the best returns that I can sustain and maintain for the longest period of time?”4. Simple is sexy. Boring and unexciting may not be sexy, but it’s effective. Morgan Housel invests most of his money by dollar cost averaging into the S&P 500.5. Simplicity scales. Complexity fails. The more you know, the less you engage in tricks, hacks, or schemes.6. Create a cushion. You want to have room for error in case things go wrong. Morgan has no debt and a lot of cash.7. Focus, focus, focus. Shiny object syndrome ruins people.===What were your takeaways from my convo with Morgan Housel?If you enjoyed this, reshare it with others and follow me Noah Kagan for more like this! I also share ideas in my newsletter: https://noahkagan.comPS – Morgan recently released his new book Same As Ever. I’ve already bought a copy and am loving it.",

    "content": "Here are 7 ideas from my favorite book of all time ‘Million Miles in A Thousand Years’ on how to create a meaningful story for your life:1. Bitter vs. Better. When something happens to you, you have two choices in how to deal with it. You can either get bitter, or get better.2. Joy costs pain. Everyone wants to live a great story, but few are willing to make it happen. 3. Fear is not real. Fear is a manipulative emotion that can trick us into living a boring life.4. Conflict gives stories meaning. A conflict-free life is an uneventful life.5. Perfection is a myth. When you stop expecting people to be perfect, you make space to appreciate them for who they are.6. Characters must change. If the protagonist hasn’t changed by the end of the story, what was the point?7. Don’t wait to express love. We don't know how much we are capable of loving until the people we love are taken away, and a beautiful story has ended.==These were a few lessons I learned from Donald MillerWhich lesson was your favorite?Mine was number 5. 👏",

    "content": "I interviewed 3 entrepreneurs who make over $1M/year with ZERO employees.Here’s what they told me…1. What’s your business?Justin Welsh: “I sell information products that help people become solopreneurs using social media.”Neville Medhora: “I run Copywriting Course where I help people optimize emails, homepages, and newsletters for companies.”Sam Parr: “I’m most known for The Hustle, a daily email that’s read by close to 3M people a day.”2. How did you get started?Justin Welsh: “I’ve worked in healthcare tech for a decade, so I started consulting for other healthcare technology companies that wanted to grow their sales and marketing revenue.”Neville Medhora: “I helped Noah write better emails for AppSumo using copywriting. Eventually, a lot of people asked us how we were writing such good emails. So I recorded a short video and sold it as a course.”Sam Parr: “I created a conference called HustleCon. I would get speakers, write content, promote the content, and sell tickets. In my first year, I did $550k in revenue.”3. What are the benefits of solopreneurship?Justin: “I am the owner of every part of my business. I’m accountable to myself. I can go on vacation whenever I want. I don’t answer to anybody. I no longer have fear of losing that control.”Neville: “You can do whatever the hell you want. Like some days I literally don’t do anything. It’s not a joke or an exaggeration. Certain days, I just scroll social media and browse Reddit.”Sam: “You can make a lot of money just by yourself with a phone. I know a bunch of people doing $3M-$4M in revenue with just them and an assistant selling information on Gumroad and using Twitter to get popular.”4. What advice would you give your past self?Justin: “Build an audience. Take all the people that you love following and reverse engineer their journey. Once you have an audience, you have leverage and optionality to start any other business.”Neville: “Sell a digital product first. There are high margins, little to no replication cost, and no shipping fees. Also, do something that people already pay you for. Use your strengths.”Sam: “Start a newsletter. Learn a topic. Be 2-3 weeks ahead of your audience. Write about what you’re learning. Monetize through advertising or different offers.”==These guys make more than Fortune 500 CEO’s by using the skillset they already have. What’s one of your strengths you can use to get started?",

You only get so many years where they WANT to hang out with you.• I wish I learned how to sell earlier. Instead, I wasted my twenties stuck in a boring job because I was too afraid to ask for a promotion.• I wish I had written down more of my ideas and plans. All those ideas were lost.• I have no regrets at all. You learn from setbacks and defeat.2) How money affects their life:• Relationships are the true currency of life. The better relationships you have, the better life you’ll lead.• Money can’t buy happiness, but it eliminates the stress of worrying about money.3) On their proudest moment:• Going from $0 to $1M per month.• Helping kids with criminal records turn their lives around.• Playing a small role in people’s success on a daily basis is hugely rewarding.4) On the silliest thing they spent money on:• Possessions like cars and boats all ended up being meaningless.5) On the best money they ever spent:• On my own self-development. On my family to create experiences.• On my children’s college education and their wedding.• On a preschool that helps underprivileged children.6) Advice to someone starting out in their career:• Get rid of your sense of entitlement. The world owes you NOTHING.• There are more treacherous people out there than you might realize. Avoid them at all costs.• Nobody cares about what you can do. They care what you can do FOR THEM.• Write stuff down, recruit a mentor, and build a peer network.7) Quotes they live by:• “A rising tide RARELY lifts all boats. You still have to be good when the tide is riding.”• “If it is to be, it is up to me. Get up, get off your butt, and get to work.”",

It’s too big a world to spend most of your life being a cubicle monkey. 🐒2. Being busy is a form of laziness when you’re working on the wrong things.3. Most people choose unhappiness over uncertainty. 😯4. What we fear doing most is usually what we most need to do.5. Do not overestimate the competition and underestimate yourself.6. \"Someday\" is a disease that will take your dreams to the grave with you. 🪦7. Eliminate tasks before you automate them. Automate tasks before you delegate them. Never create unnecessary work for yourself (or your team members).8. If someone isn’t making you stronger, they’re making you weaker.9. Reality is negotiable.10. Life is not a race. Take it slower. Enjoy the music, before the song is over. 🎶==Which lesson was your favorite?Mine was number 6. 👏",

    "content": "I’m over 40 years old and LOVING it.I had Mark Manson, my long-time friend and author of “The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck,” on my podcast and he agreed:“Don’t listen to people who complain about getting old. Being 30 years old is SO much better than being 20. And being 40 is even better.”But why is that?When you’re in your 20s, say you try to be 1% better every day. But you don’t see any rewards for your efforts yet (and it sucks) 😓But once you’re 40, you’re so much further along than you thought possible - the accomplishments accumulated 🥳 That’s why getting older is pretty sweet. Small daily actions compound over time.Mark drops more nuggets: As you age, you realize that temporary highs are not happiness.Mark got to experience crazy highs on the road at event after event with high-powered people and celebrities complimenting his work. (What a rush!)But then he realized how exhausted he was. He hadn’t seen his wife in three weeks.It’s easy to mistake temporary joy for long-term happiness. It’s healthy to enjoy spending time at home and absolutely love your day-to-day life.You also have to really love your work, especially in creative fields.When Mark’s book came out, he would walk into publisher’s meetings and they would say “You’re the biggest debuted author in the last 10 years. How does it feel to be an overnight success?”But wait a second…Mark had been grinding for a whole decade prior. He started his career by writing consistently for 2 years with NO income before gaining traction little by little.Here’s an analogy that proved his point - Mark heard someone say: “I want to be a YouTuber, but I don’t enjoy making videos.”Well then don’t be a YouTuber.That’s like saying, “I want to write a book, but I don’t enjoy writing.”You have to do the work. You have to love the work.There are no shortcuts.",

Deliver more value than anybody else”James found his niche in the energy market, trading some of the most volatile markets in the world.His value was his strategy, taking calculated risks with massive rewards.2. “Punch through your comfort zones”Everyone has a level they’re comfortable with, in every aspect of life.Successful people smash through their own glass ceilings, and James is no exception. He quit his job at UPS, joined the Navy, and swears by all of his decisions.3. “Retain who you are, you don’t need to impress anybody. Who gives a f*ck?”You don’t need to be flashy to be successful. Working hard in silence will deliver results, and those results speak for themselves.James learnt from his time in the Navy that “showing you’re trying” is worthless, you need to do to succeed.If you want insights into my own advice, you can find tips in the “Lost Chapter” from my upcoming book - Million Dollar Weekend: https://lnkd.in/eYgVTW-e",

    "content": "If you know anything about Baseball, you’ve probably heard of Mattress Mack.He made history last year by winning a $75m bet on the World Series.I asked the straight-shooting furniture millionaire how he made his money, and how it changed his life.Jim ‘Mack’ McIngvale has been running the Gallery Furniture chain out of Houston, Texas for over 40 years. At one point, things were looking bleak, so he invested all of the $10,000 he had saved into a TV commercial.He HAD to get it right.Jim wasn’t happy with how the professionals were producing his commercial, so he took matters into his own hands. He rapidly reeled off his sales pitch to fit into his time slot, finishing with the now infamous “saves you money!”Gallery Furniture has been a success ever since.In the words of Jim: “Life’s hard. Get used to it.”Success doesn’t come easy, don’t make excuses when it doesn’t happen. “When things don’t go your way, you get up in the morning and you get back to work.”Persistence is everything.“Get off your a*s and get to work”If you aren’t going to be the one to get up and get stuff done, who are you expecting to do it for you? That’s the Great American virtue of self-reliance.“Relationships are the currency of life”Money didn’t improve Jim’s life, but the people he met certainly did.He funds a trade school in his local area that teaches plumbing, electricity, and construction skills - he says it’s the best money he’s ever spent.“I wish I could have spent more time with my kids”He spent so much effort trying to grow his business to be something that they can hold onto, something good for the community. You can always make more money, but you can never get back your time.Mack made millions from his enthusiastic personality and hard-working attitude. He says he has no regrets, and he’s always looking forward to the future.What an inspiration.Check out the free Lost Chapter of my upcoming book Million Dollar Weekend: https://lnkd.in/eYgVTW-e",

    "content": "Alan Weiss has published over 70 books on consulting. The best-seller, Million-Dollar Consulting, is on it’s Sixth edition.If there’s ANYONE who knows about making money and the skills you need to do it, it’s him.Here’s his 7 takeaways on all things money 💰:1. Follow what makes you happy.Everyone says money can’t buy happiness. But money can buy things that *create* happiness.“We’re in a consumer society right now, don’t kid yourself.”If the thing that makes you happy is a Rolls Royce, you work towards that.2. Know your strengths, and capitalize on them.“I believe that we should be philanthropic, have safety nets, have valuable healthcare and education. But I also believe that talent outs.”If you’re great at something, you get paid well for it.3. Have no regrets.Defeats are nothing more than a learning experience. “The learning is even greater from setbacks.” Don’t be afraid to fail, it can push you closer to success.4. Network as early as you can.“I didn’t take as many names when I was younger as I should have.” Success is often as much down to WHO you know, as it is what you know.Start as soon as you can, and keep those names close.5. Take pride in what you do.“Every day I can look around and see a global community of people I’ve coached, and how most of them can get out of it their own way of prospering.”Playing any role in how other people succeed is incredibly rewarding.6. Invest in yourself.“The best money I ever spent was on my own self-development.” Learning new things and bettering yourself as a person will always be a net positive in the long run.If you want to do better, be better.7. Stay accountable.Accountability to yourself, to your family, and to your network are all important. Alan paid for his kids’ college tuition, their wedding, and for them to do things as a family.“I feel as though that is my responsibility.”",

    "content": "I went door knocking on the fanciest houses I could find and asked their owners how they built their fortune.You’d be surprised how many answered.Here are their main secrets to success:The first guy I approached (in a $2.2m house) told me the most important thing was doing what you loved.“How did you find what you loved?”, I asked.“I didn’t! I wanted to be a singer”, he said.Let life guide you. After moving to a different city with his husband, he ended up having jobs at big companies like Adobe, Yahoo, and Nvidia. Planning is crucial, but sometimes going off script is better.Embrace unexpected turns; they might be leading you to success.A lady in a $2.8m house told me: “As a designer, I didn’t know how to break into the design world. I’m fortunate because my husband decided to open up a business and I got to design for them.” Together, they built and sold a successful animal health company.Choose a co-builder, not just a companion. Find a partner you can pave the path to success with, brick by brick.The journey becomes a lot easier.A guy in a $2m house told me it was his father-in-law who bought the property, and now he worked there remotely as a software developer.“Covid opened up the world for entrepreneurs again. Anybody can start a business out of their house now.”The main takeaway here? Marry a landlord’s daughter!Jokes aside, gone are the days of brick-and-mortar businesses or moving to Silicon Valley. Now you can work towards your vision from ANYWHERE in the world.An artist who lives in a $1.9m house shared his story:“When I was younger, I wanted to be a painter. But I didn’t really think I’d ever make it.” He was able to surround himself with art dealers and artists, got a small opportunity at a gallery and landed his first $20k check.Don’t undervalue the power of Networking. Surround yourself with people with similar interests and goals, and keep the names of people who may be able to help you in the future.It’s never too early to start.An ex-marine who works in the homebuilding industry. After giving me a tour of a $2.6m house he built, I asked him “What inspires you to do this stuff?”“It’s definitely not about money for me. It’s the legacy.”Build for legacy, not just money. Success isn’t always about financial gain. For some, it's the pride of leaving a lasting mark in the world.A writer in a $4.4m house told me:“I’ve been working since I was fourteen. You’ve got to do that to get the dream life. You can’t be successful without discipline unless you’re born into it.” Discipline, organization, and attentiveness are the best predictors of success.",

    "content": "You travel to America with $500 in your back pocket.Forty years later, the company you founded is worth $2 billion, with a brand recognized all over the world.This is the incredible true story of Brian Smith, the founder of UGG:Like most incredibly successful founders, Brian didn’t set out to be an entrepreneur. Actually, he spent 10 years training to be an accountant. He worked during the day, and studied at night.The day he graduated, he quit his job.By this point, a lot of Brian’s friends were earning good money. Meanwhile, he was still in the same spot as he was 10 years ago. So he packed his bags and moved to the land of new trends and opportunities - California.One day whilst surfing in Malibu, Brian pulled on a pair of sheepskin boots, and had an epiphany:“There’s no UGG boots in America… we’re going to be millionaires!”At the time, he had no idea that it would take 20 years to get there…In the first year of business, Brian only sold 28 pairs of boots.So, he changed strategy. He invested in advertising and ran some ads with some models wearing UGG boots. Second-year scales: skyrocketed to 10,000 pairs!Brian’s strategy for the third year: hire better-looking models and a photographer.Sales increased to 25,000 pairs.By this point, he was working on a golf course, trying to get rid of his inventory. Here, he learned the most important lesson about branding:“You never advertise the product, you advertise the lifestyle”Brian received feedback that his ads looked too fake, with the models and the posing. So, he went to a beach and photographed ads with professional surfers,Overnight, sales increased to 220k pairs.“Brand is not your trademark registration, its not your logo, its not your product. Brand is what people think of you.”With this newfound attitude, Brian snowballed into becoming a millionaire. In 1995, he sold the business for $15 million.Today, Brian has settled in California. He’s worked on other projects, including his book, ‘Birth of a Brand’, which tells the full story of his entrepreneurial journey.This guy is amazing!",

    "content": "Is college even worth it?I spoke to multi-millionaire dropouts to ask them if they regret not going to college.Here’s the advice everyone needs to know:1. Everything’s reversible (almost)Millionaires don’t waste time on indecision.They make the best choice based on the information they have, and then deal with the consequences.2. Follow your fearsMost people DON’T become millionaires because they stay in the zone of safety.High risk = high reward3. Don’t work on your weakest skillsHone in on your strongest ones, and find people who compliment your weaknesses.Together you create one superhuman.4. Dropping out of college ≠ uneducatedFormal education is just ONE path to knowledgeRead books, attend seminars, find mentors.Always be learning.5. Think like an athleteTom Brady wouldn’t challenge Tiger Woods to a round and expect to win.Play games where YOU have the advantage.6. Always have a planIt doesn’t matter what you’re doing, just as long as you have a plan.Without one, you’re going nowhere.7. Start with social mediaSocial media has the LOWEST barrier to entry and an UNCAPPED potential.You can start an account today with $0 in your back pocket.8. Trust your instinctIf your instinct is telling you to do something, always do it.Your subconscious knows more than you do.9. Education ≠ SuccessSuccess isn’t defined by a college certificate.Success is whatever YOU decide it to be.Honor your inner feelings. If college feels right for you, then go do it. But if it doesn’t, then create your own path.",

    "content": "I knocked on doors in West Lake Hills, Texas - the neighborhood where Joe Rogan, Matthew McConaughey, and Lance Armstrong live - to see what the people there did for a living.I’ve been doing this for years, but there was still one story that surprised me.West Lake Hills is a very exclusive neighborhood. Almost every house here sells for over 2 million dollars. Most stories were people talking about starting their own business, but that’s not the only way to success.One owner is the Director of Finance at a software company.You can become rich without owning your own business. He doesn’t own the company, and he doesn’t have the responsibility that comes with that. He started at the bottom, got promoted, and now lives his dream life.He started his path in finance early, and followed his passions from Day 1.“I was one of those nerdy little kids who likes to stare at the stock market charts”If you’re stuck on what you want to do in life, think back to your interests as a child!He does have one tip for people who want to take that extra step into making money: Think about what skills you already have and enjoy using, and apply those to something new.For him, that would be investing, where he can use his financial knowledge to gain an edge. For you, that could be anything.Before you go into anything, think about what your edge is:- What skills do you have?- Which ones do you enjoy applying?- How can they make you money?This is how every success story begins.Check out the free Lost Chapter of my upcoming book Million Dollar Weekend: https://lnkd.in/eYgVTW-e",

    "content": "The 10 commandments of an entrepreneur (that I live by):1. No codingFigure out if people actually want your service or not BEFORE you put time and money into building it. Validate your ideas first.2. Keep it simpleFocus on the real thing that customers want. Sometimes it's more effective to hand-draw an app on paper vs. taking time and money to build out a full iPhone app.3. What’s the problem?Avoid creating a solution for a problem that doesn’t exist. Look for problems before coming up with ideas and work backwards from there to solve them and find your business.4. Find your place on the totem poleThe Totem Pole is how important you are to your customer. A high mark on the totem pole is that the customer really needs you vs. a low mark is a 'nice-to-have.'5. Don’t be needyThis is when you want things like business cards, LLC papers, other useless tools before you can move on. If you want the bells and whistles before you are profitable, you’re adding barriers to yourself and worrying about the wrong thing.6. Maintain momentumThere will be an \"aha\" moment when people want what you are offering and more often than not, that comes from continually doing at least one small thing each day.7. Use time limitations You will be more creative and save time and money by limiting the time you put into starting your business. Parkinson's Law dictates that a task will swell in perceived importance and complexity in relation to the time allotted for its completion. It is the magic of the imminent deadline.8. Velocity to $1 (This is HUGE)I can remember when I started NinjaCard (a college discount card) and made my first $9 in profit. As I put the discount card in the envelope I recall thinking, “I’m actually running my own business”.Once you reduce all barriers and get to your first $1 that will open your eyes and create excitement to continue.9. Handle adversityThere will be a time when you will be challenged; how you persevere is what will separate you from everyone else.10. Do not ignore your fearsRunning a business is daunting. I’m not here to tell you it won’t be tough and challenging - it will - but it’s not impossible. Take your fears head on, don’t ignore them and hope they’ll go away.Since you'll be living by these commandments for the rest of your life, why not save this post for later, or put them somewhere you’ll ALWAYS see them.",

If you don’t get the grades, you get fired”.You’ve got to put in the work and just get things done.Tip 4: Order Dessert FirstDon’t water things down, you always want the best first.

Learn to sell.Everything you do is sales. You need to be able to sell your product to customers, sell your ideas to team members or investors, sell your skill set to employers.2. Lean into your fears.Success often involves overcoming fears, doubts and scepticism from others, but mostly from yourself.3. Live your life in decades:20’s: Try everything, do interesting stuff, and experiment with different careers30’s: Figure out what you do best having spent a decade trying different things40’s: Make money from what you do best50’s: Try not to do too much4. Learn from your competition.Use their weaknesses to your advantage, and become better than them at their own strengths.5. Enjoy your business, but never love your business.As soon as you love your business, you lose all objectivity and won’t make rational decisions.6. Be persistent.Every billionaire I have interviewed has faced adversity, but persisted anyway. That’s what separates the successful from the rest.7. Money changes everything.When the money hits the table, that's when you find out the real character of people. Figure out who shares your values, and cut ties with anyone who doesn’t.8. You don’t build your business, your customers do.It doesn’t matter what you think of your product, it matters what your customers think. No customers = no money.9. There’s no such thing as an overnight success.Every “overnight success” story is actually a story of years of hard work and persistence. No one became a billionaire in 24 hours.10. The best decisions don’t often follow rationality.What do all self-made billionaires have in common? They go against rational and take huge risks. Huge risks = huge rewards.",
